AIMS2-SF was not converted to a score of 0 to 10 but was expressed on a scale from 0 to 50. \n1.2. Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a 38 item generic health-related quality of life measure (range 0 to 600, higher score for greater health problems)\n2. Patient dexterity, evaluated by occupational therapists using Sequential Occupational Dexterity Assessment (SODA) or self reported by patients using Duruoz Hand Index (DHI) and a self report questionnaire. \n2.1. SODA consists of 12 standardized tasks evaluated by occupational therapists and ranges from 0 to 108. \n2.2. The purpose of DHI (range 0-90) was to measure hand ability while performing personal hygiene, office tasks and other general activities\n3. Simple Erosions Narrowing Score (SENS, range 0-86) considers erosions in 32 joints in the hands and 12 in the feet, and joint space narrowing in 30 and 12 joints respectively. The total SENS score was assessed by a single radiologist unaware of the group assignment. \n4. Disease activity was determined using Disease Activity Score (DAS 28, range 0.14-9.3). A 28 joint count for swelling and tenderness was assessed by a rheumatologist unaware of the treatment allocation. Patients rated their general health on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. DAS 28 was calculated using the three previously mentioned parameters and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). \n5.

Three or four members of the medical staff (rheumatologist, physiotherapist or occupational therapist) took part in each session for 5 hours a day during a 4 week period. During the first week, patients benefited from hydrotherapy and occupational therapy input. Knowledge of the disease and physical capacity was evaluated for each participant in order to design, after multidisciplinary co-ordination, a patient-specific exercise program. The second week of the program focused on the influence of RA on daily activities. Muscle strengthening against resistance (of pain-free joints) replaced the hydrotherapy. The occupational therapy program in the third week included skill exercises and daily activities with increasing difficulty (endurance and exercises against resistance). During the forth week the exercises focused on office tasks. Pain and fatigue were prevented by regular breaks and relaxation in order to improve pain tolerance and self-esteem. \n\nPatients allocated to control group had usual care physical therapy according to French recommendations. Briefly, standard joint rehabilitation consisted of interactive lessons taught by rheumatologists, physiotherapists or occupational therapists and meetings for groups of 3 to 4 patients over the course of three days.

The  hypothesis to be considered is: Mobilisation applied to a joint in the neck alters head position sense in healthy subjects. The Null hypothesis is that mobilisation applied to a joint in the neck does not have any effect on head position sense. \n\nThe proposed design involves one group of subjects and repeated random measures will be taken on these subjects. The subjects will undergo two conditions in a random order, to minimise the potential for an order effect. Randomisation will occur by utilising opaque envelopes containing a number indicating the condition to be performed first. The envelopes will contain an equal number of the conditions and will be well shuffled. Subjects will select an envelope on commencing the study and this will determine the order in which they undergo the conditions. Thus testing of head position sense will be performed before and after both conditions. The two conditions involved are mobilisation (condition one), which will be compared with a control condition of lying still for 5 minutes (condition two). A control condition is included to determine whether any change in head position sense relates to the mobilisation or merely repeating the test.  The subjects will essentially act as their own 'controls' since they will complete both conditions. Measurements will be taken during two separate testing sessions. Previous studies assessing the effect of manual therapy using a repeated random measures design have performed the conditions on separate days, presumably to be able to assess the true effect of each condition. It is recognised that these studies also included a placebo condition, however they demonstrated that this produced minimal or non-significant changes when assessing heart rate, respiratory rate and skin conductance in normal subjects . Although assessing the placebo effect of manual treatment on proprioception could be beneficial, the lack of significant changes in previous studies and the time and economical restraints on the researcher mean that a placebo condition will not be included in the present study. \n\nHead position sense will be measured using the helmet method that has been used in several other studies. This method involves subjects wearing a helmet tied firmly to their heads, with a light beam attached to the top of the helmet and pointing to a target 90cm in front of the subjects. The target is mobile to facilitate the zeroing of the target in relation to the light beam on top of the subjects head. The target used will be similar to that used by a previous study, this involves a large sheet of graph paper divided into four by two axes, with the intersecting point being the centre of the target. It is thought that this target will facilitate accurate measurement, be practical and measurements can be checked after the testing session since one sheet of graph paper can be used and marked for each subject. Subjects will be seated facing the target with their vision occluded by goggles. They will be asked to concentrate for several seconds on the straight - ahead position, which corresponds to the centre of the target. They are then asked to perform a movement of the head and to try to return to the original position as closely as possible, without speed instruction. The point that the light beam stops is marked (a laser beam is usually used to facilitate accuracy). The global error relating to the centre of the target and the error in relation to the horizontal and vertical axes is measured. This provides a measurement of head repositioning accuracy.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder14099-0", "Funder14099-1", "Funder14099-2"], "contactId": "Contact51646_14099", "sponsorId": "Sponsor50215"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51646_14099", "title": "Miss", "forename": "Amanda", "surname": "Phillips", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Box 185\nPhysiotherpay Department\nAddenbrooke's NHS Trust", "city": "Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB2 2QQ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)1223 216633"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "amandaphillips_uk@Yahoo.co.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor50215", "organisation": "Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder14099-0", "name": "Cambridge Consortium - Addenbrooke's (UK)", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder14099-1", "name": "Own Account", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder14099-2", "name": "NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2008-07-18T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "23", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2005-09-12T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "93133646"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "The effect of light and/or melatonin on sleep, mood, cognition and behavior in demented elderly", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "A large proportion of the demented elderly show fragmented sleep-wake patterns and disturbed circadian rhythms.
