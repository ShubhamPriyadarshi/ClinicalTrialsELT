It is estimated that the number of diabetics worldwide will double by the year 2010.\n1. This is primarily as a result of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes.\n2. The cost of managing diabetes is also high with 5% of the total NHS resources and up to 10% of hospital in-patient resources being used to care for those with this chronic disease.\nThe focus of care for chronic diseases such as diabetes is now directed towards risk factor management and the prevention of complications. With this shift of emphasis patient education and empowerment has advanced from being an adjunct to medical therapy to an intervention in its own right.\nFew educational initiatives aimed at type 2 diabetic patients in a primary care setting have been carried out in the UK.\n3. Control of cardiovascular risk factors has been identified as having a key role in the prevention of macro-vascular complications in type 2 diabetes.\n4. Evidence exists indicating the importance of lipid lowering therapy and maintaining satisfactory cholesterol levels in diabetic patients.\n5. However there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions focusing on this risk factor.\nThis pilot study will examine and compare the effect of a patient education intervention, aimed at the satisfactory control of cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients with usual care. It will employ a randomised control trial design.\nThe study hypothesis to be answered is whether an intervention based on adult educational and behavioural principles, aimed at type 2 diabetic patients, will improve patient knowledge of cholesterol control and improve physiological measurement of cholesterol.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.
