Unfortunately most of immunosuppressive agents, whether are they of pharmacological or biological nature are associated with severe, attending risk for serious complications, at level of different organs and apparatuses. In order to circumvent need for the recipint's general immunosuppression we had developed since the mid '80s a method to envelop the isolated islets within highly biocompatible and selective permeable microcapsules, based on alginic acid (a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweeds) and aminoacidic polycations. Such microcapsules, implemented over the years have been extensively employed in pre-clinical trials where either low or high mammal animal models with either induced or spontaneous diabetes underwent graft of microencapsulated islets. The particular nature and composition of the capsules make these artificial shields very suitable for easy injection in the recipients' peritoneal cavity, with no induction, due to their high biocompatibility, of any inflammatory cell response. The positive results obtained in rodents with spontaneous diabetes (nonobese diabetic [NOD] mice) where encapsulated islet xenografts (rat to mouse; pig to mouse; human to mouse) were able to reverse hyperglycemia for extraordinary long periods of time prompted us to scale up to dogs, and recently mokeys with spontaneous or induced diabetes. Also in these higher mammals positive results were obtained in terms of both, correction of hyperglycemia and absence of inflammatory cell overgrowth of the capsules. Having completed the pre-clinicals we turned our attention to humans. In order to make our capsules suitable for human application we have upscaled our system for ultrapurification of the basic capsules' constituent (alginic acid) so as to obtain a pyrogen-free, endotoxin-free alginic acid (according to FDA guidelines) that is low in protein content (<0.4%, according to the 'bioinvisibility' criterion laid out by FDA).", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.

The effect of IFN-beta in relapsing-remitting MS is primarily directed against the Th1-driven inflammatory demyelinating attack. IFN-beta may interfere with cell trafficking by decreasing the expression of adhesion molecules and inhibit matrix metalloproteinases; reduce the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II molecules on antigen presenting cells; inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of IFN-beta on clinical disease activity is only moderate and many patients have only a partial treatment response.\n\nThe possible beneficial effect of intravenous methylprednisolone in delaying the onset of MS after optic neuritis has been suggested to be due to its anti-inflammatory and/or immune regulatory activity. Since IFN-beta also has such biological and immunological properties it seems justified to investigate the potential effect of the combination of methylprednisolone and IFN-beta in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Further methylprednisolone might have a positive effect on the occurrence of side effects to IFN-beta treatment and might reduce the occurrence of neutralising antibodies against IFN-beta. Adjuvant intermittent treatment with methylprednisolone is easy to administer, well tolerated and relatively inexpensive.
