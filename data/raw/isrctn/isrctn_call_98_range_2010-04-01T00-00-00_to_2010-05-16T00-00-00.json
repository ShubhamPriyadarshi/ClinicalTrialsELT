Until recently the golden standard treatment for this superficial venous incompetence was to perform a crossectomy and a stripping of the saphenous vein. Unfortunately this radical treatment has some disadvantages like post-operative pain, haematomas in the stripping area, paresthesia and a high recurrence rate.\n\nEndovenous laser treatment (ELT) has been introduced as a new mini-invasive alternative. The difference with the classic treatment is that the crossectomy is no longer performed and the saphenous vein is obliterated in a percutaneous way. The most common used lasers have a frequency of 810 - 940 - 980 nm and recently 1320 - 1500 nm. This treatment has a substantial lower morbidity, a shorter sick leave and less post-operative pain compared with a classical stripping. Nevertheless some inconveniences such as post-operative ecchymosis, bruising and periphlebitis jeopardise the recovery.\n\nSome of these side-effects can be due to the direct contact between the fibre tip and the vessel wall. From a technical point of view ELT also has some imperfections: the bare fibre used for ELT is a rigid fibre. When this fibre is introduced in a saphenous vein, which usually has some small tortuosities and turnings, the fibre has always a tendency to stretch. As a consequence of this stretching, the fibre tip frequently hits the vessel wall. Examining the fibre location on per-operative ultrasound control, we can see the fibre tip most frequently situated in a very eccentric position in the vein, with the tip touching the vein wall. \n\nTumescent anaesthesia induces spasm of the vein around the fibre and can diminish this effect. But even then, especially in larger veins, the fibre tip stays in an eccentric position. When in such a situation the energy is delivered at the fibre tip, a direct contact between the fibre tip and the vessel wall results in a destruction and ulceration or perforation of the vein. A consequence of this is a very uneven application of light energy. When a specimen of vein, which has been treated with ELT, is examined histologically, a line of damaged vessel wall is seen with carbonised vein wall and ulcerations and perforations, while the rest of the vessel wall stays unaffected. These perforations cause the post-operative appearance of ecchymosis and can also injure the perivenous tissue, especially when the tumescent fluid is not correctly surrounding the vein. Other parts of the vein wall remain unaffected. This uneven energy application can be the cause of some of the imperfections of ELT, like post-operative ecchymosis, inflammation around the treated vein (periphlebitis) and pain. \n\nAim of the study:\nIn this prospective trial we like to evaluate the use of a new safety fibre tip. The tulip-shaped self-expandable distal end at the fibre tip expands intraluminally and pushes away the vein wall. The shape of the self expandable tip allows withdrawal from the fibre and catheter according to the usual procedure. The special shape however helps to prevent the fibre moving further into the vein, thus minimising the risk entering the deep venous system and will avoid possible damage, like perforation of the vein wall, while navigating into the veins.\n\nCan the use of this safety fibre tip avoid some of the imperfections of ELT? In this trial two patient groups will be compared: one in which a normal bare fibre is used and a second one in which the safety fibre tip is used. Primary outcome will be the occlusion rates at 1 month and 6 months post-operatively. Secondary outcomes will be the possible side-effects of these treatments: looking for the post-operative incapacity to work, the amount of used painkillers, the appearence of post-operative ecchymosis, periphlebitis and a post-operative quality of life-score.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Occlusion rate of the treated veins at one month and six months post-operatively: \nA duplex scan is scheduled at one month and six months.

This duplex score makes it possible to evaluate the morphological development of the treated veins. For this purpose we used the proximal measured diameter of the treated vein, which is located 2 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction. This diameter was compared in the various outpatient reviews, and the veins were classified using the GELEV score. Morphological change after treatment:\nLevel 0: no occlusion, refluxing vein, unchanged vein\nLevel 1a: partial occlusion with proximal reflux\nLevel 1b: partial occlusion without reflux\nLevel 2a: complete occlusion with unchanged  or larger diameter\nLevel 2b: complete occlusion with diameter reduction greater than 30%\nLevel 3: complete occlusion with diameter reduction greater than 50%\nLevel 4: fibrotic cord, vein not visible", "secondaryOutcome": "Possible side-effects of the treatment:\n1.

The CIVIQ2 has been demonstrated to be a valid, reliable, stable and sensitive scale.

Briefly, the bone window was about 15 cm in diameter with duraplasty using expanded dura substitute when necessary. The anterior was frontal to the midpupillary lines, and the posterior line was about 3 - 4 cm posterior to the external acustic meatus. The superior line was 2 cm of the lateral edge of the superior sagittal sinus, and the inferior line was extended below the level of the zygomatic arch, so that the frontal and temporal base could be explored. Durotomy was performed over the entire region of bony decompression as a stellate shape. Cranioplasty was performed after 3 months.\n\nPost-operative therapy was similar with those previously described, which included keeping respiratory tract unobstructed (with assisted ventilation to ensure arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) greater than or equal to 95% against hypoxia and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) maintained near 40mm Hg at 37\u00b0C), intubations if necessary, controlling the blood glucose level and body temperature and balancing water and electrolyte, dehydration and diuresis, homeostasis balanced, anti-infection with sensitive antibiotics and so on.\n\nThe control group received the unilateral routine temporoparietal craniectomy and the operation site depended on the location of injury and midline shift accordingly.

The need assessment considered the replacement of all missing teeth by fixed or removable partial dentures or dental implants as a necessity especially in cases of shortened dental arches. Modern prosthetic concepts distinguish between different dimensions of need (normative need, perceived need) being well aware of the fact that perceived need has been under-represented in the past. An innovative sight puts a higher emphasis to the subjective components of need assessment and outcome measurement. Generally three adverse effects of non-replacement of molars were postulated: temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, tooth migration/overeruption, insufficient chewing ability. However, no evidence based on randomised trials has been provided concerning the incidence of the adverse side effects mentioned above, nor is there high-level evidence regarding a benefit of removable dentures for molar replacement. On the contrary removable partial dentures are compromised by a high incidence of adverse side effects such as plaque accumulation and peridontal breakdown. \n\nAmong therapeutic alternatives, an approach with a limited restoration goal focused on incisors, canines and premolars (shortened dental arch [SDA] concept) has been described and implemented although discussed controversially. Within this concept, fixed partial dentures are used for tooth replacement of which a superior performance compared with removable partial dentures has been reported. The multicentre study was initiated in 2000 because evidence was lacking concerning the benefit of different therapeutic options regarding the preservation of oral health, oral health related quality of life, patients satisfaction, absence of discomfort, satisfactory chewing ability and aesthetic satisfaction. Public health aspects of the study lie in the fields of health economics, avoidance of over-treatment, and therapy guidelines on a population based level. \n\nTwo prosthetic therapy arms will be compared: \n1. The replacement of posterior teeth at last up to the first molar by removable partial dentures \n2. Prosthetic treatment according to the shortened dental arch concept. To avoid removable partial dentures, posterior teeth are replaced up to the second premolar by fixed restorations, if necessary. Molars are not replaced. \n\nThe aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that the treatment outcome varies depending on the treatment concept (fixed versus removable prostheses) in the therapy of patients with missing molars.\n\nPlease note that the pilot phase of this trial has been completed.

With this regime it is possible to attain relieve of clinical symptoms and normalisation of laboratory parameters in a number of cases. In contrast to the situation in adulthood, clinical remission on and off medication in JIA is possible. Therefore, it has been reported that discontinuation of MTX should be considered after an adequate period of remission.\n\nAbout 50% of the patients experience a relapse after discontinuation of the immunosuppressive therapy. It is not yet clear if a longer duration of MTX treatment in the status of remission is able to reduce the overall risk of relapses over the course of the disease. Thus, treatment with MTX is continued for a variable time span after documentation of remission and according to the personal beliefs of the attending physicians. \n\nRecently a definition of clinical remission for JIA has been proposed based on clinical examination and laboratory parameters. We also demonstrated that analyses of the phagocyte-specific proteins myeloid related-protein 8 (MRP 8) and MRP 14 provide excellent markers for the disease activity of JIA.\n\nThe present study was designed for the follow-up of two groups of patients with JIA, in whom remission was achieved using MTX. In group 1, treatment with MTX will be discontinued as early as six months after documentation of remission on medication. In group 2, treatment with MTX will be discontinued later than 12 months after documentation of remission on medication.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Number of relapses", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

It will compare two 'diet, exercise and motivation' programs with each other and with a 'brief advice' control group. All subjects will all have been identified as having pre-diabetes mellitus. \n\nPhase two of the study starts after six months. Subjects randomised to the two Intensive Courses will finish their programs and will then simply be observed for a further six months. At the six month point the control group subjects will be randomised to one or other of the two diet/motivation courses. They are therefore a control group for six months and a wait-for-randomisation group until the second six months. In this way they too will have the benefits of the education, motivation and exercise programme. It is an 'all win' scenario. \n\nThe principal research question is whether over time encouraging subjects to adopt a low glycaemic load diet will have a significantly better effect on biophysical and biochemical features of pre-diabetes than either a low calorie/low fat diet or brief advice and provision of a leaflet. \n\nNote: A low glycaemic load diet is one where blood sugar changes after the meal are minimised by making particular choices on the amount and type of carbohydrate in the meal\n\nDefinitions: \nA subject is considered to have pre-diabetes mellitus if he or she has impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance. The definitions of these are as follows:\nImpaired fasting glucose: fasting blood glucose 6.1 - 7.0 mmol/l\nImpaired glucose tolerance - two hour post load glucose 7.8 - 11.1 mmol/l\nLevels falling higher than these ranges are diagnostic of diabetes. Levels below both ranges are normal.\n\nThe biophysical markers are weight, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m^2), abdominal girth and body fat percentage. \n\nThe biochemical markers are fasting and post load glucose levels, fasting insulin and insulin/glucose ratio, total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels. \n\nIdentification of subjects: \nDoctors and practice nurses at The Nethergreen Surgery will identify subjects as having pre-diabetes mellitus.\n\nEnrolment: \nThose who are eligible for enrolment and who give fully informed consent will be randomised to one of the two diets or to the control group.\n\nConsent: \nConsent to enrolment and randomisation will be obtained by the research nurse in a face to face meeting at which the subject will have ample and unrestricted opportunity to ask questions and discuss the trial. No coercion or inducement will be offered to subjects.\n\nRandomisation: \nA member of the Institute of General Practice Medical Statistics Department will perform Randomisation. Pre-prepared closed randomisation envelopes will be used. The only stratification will be to equalise the male/female numbers in each group.\n\nCo-ordination: \nThe research nurse will co-ordinate the running of the programme including attendance for evening meetings and for collection of biochemical and biophysical data.\n\nStatistical analysis: \nStatistical analysis will be performed by Professor Campbell and will look at an analysis of variance between the groups as well as a narrative presentation of qualitative data.\n\nProbity: \nThe trial proposal is being submitted to the Ethics committee for inspection and approval\n\nPatient safety: \nPatient safety is paramount. To achieve this care will be taken in applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the trial. No special foods or supplements are used in this trial nor are any drugs or medication being used as part of the trial. The trial does not require exposure of subjects to any form of ionising radiation. Subjects may leave the trial at any stage without prejudice.\n\nPlanned Analysis:\nBaseline demographic data will be presented with appropriate statistical analysis of difference between the two groups (analysis of variance). Changes in biophysical and biochemical variables will be presented as comparisons over the duration of the trial within groups. Differences in these variables will be compared between the groups. The analysis will also be on an 'intention to treat' basis. A full analysis will be performed after the conclusion of the trial. An interim analysis will be performed at the six month stage.\n\nHow will this feasibility study contribute to the design of a subsequent larger trial?\n1. Subject numbers: One of the principal aims of the pilot study is to enable the medical statistician to calculate how many subjects would need to be recruited for the subsequent trial. It is anticipated that trends will be revealed by this pilot study which will allow a calculation of sample size for the main trial.\n2. Duration of evening meetings: The pragmatic question 'what will work in practice?' is a core principal of the ISAIAH project. A questionnaire will be used to collect this data. \n3. Content of evening meetings: An outline of the framework for the evening meetings is reproduced below. The usefulness and acceptability of our arrangement will be surveyed using the questionnaire, which is in preparation.\n4. Number of evening meetings: Are six sessions too few or two many? Data analysis will help determine this using biochemical and biophysical endpoints. However the experience and opinion of the subjects using a questionnaire will also be useful. 'Duration, Content and Meeting Number' information will be used in planning the precise intervention to be used in the cluster randomised trial.\n5. Appropriateness and utility of written support materials: Opinion will be sought on the usefulness of the books and carb/calorie counters given out during the course using a questionnaire. This will enable choices to be supported or revised for the main trial.\n6. Subjective experience of waist and hip measurement: There is anecdotal evidence that overweight people might find measuring girth slightly distasteful. This will be enquired about sensitively. This data and an analysis of its utility in predicting or tracking change will be used to decide whether to include as a required biophysical item in the main trial.\n7. Is a 2-hour post-load blood glucose level measurement necessary?. Is it an end point measurement that is useful? Is any use it may have outweighed by the inherent nuisance value it poses to subjects and trial staff alike? This will be answered by the questionnaire and by analysing and collating results from the biochemical and biophysical data analysis.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2008 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18682012 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "80c5a7a6-ac99-4325-b42b-0462ba99f7e7", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18682012"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder13908-0", "Funder13908-1"], "contactId": "Contact51537_13908", "sponsorId": "Sponsor50215"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51537_13908", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Christopher", "surname": "Barclay", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "The Nethergreen Surgery\n34-36 Nethergreen Road", "city": "Sheffield", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "S11 7EJ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)114 230 2952"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "Chris.Barclay@gp-c88034.nhs.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor50215", "organisation": "Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder13908-0", "name": "Sheffield Health and Social Research Consortium (UK)", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder13908-1", "name": "NHS R&D Support Funding (UK)", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2010-04-07T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "24", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2005-09-16T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "06774126"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "The Scottish Pregnancy Intervention Study: The effect of low molecular weight heparin and aspirin therapy on recurrent pregnancy loss", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "SPIN", "studyHypothesis": "Does treatment with low dose aspirin and Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) in women with consecutive recurrent pregnancy loss(es) at less than/equal to 24 weeks gestation (and no evidence of anatomical, endocrine, chromosomal or immunological abnormality) result in a reduction in the rate of expected loss in the index pregnancy from 25% to 15% or less?\n\nPlease note that as of 13/11/2007 the funding by the Chief Scientist Office was extended from 31/05/2007 to the 31/12/2008 for this trial.

To date, there has been little attention given to the possible protective role of n-3 LCPs in age-related loss of cognitive or retinal function.  OPAL is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial carried out among adults aged 70-79 years in the UK. The intervention arm will receive a daily capsule containing 700 mg n-3 LCP (both decosahexaenoic acid DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid EPA) while the placebo arm will receive a daily capsule containing olive oil. The main outcome variable assessed at 24 months will be cognitive performance and a second major outcome variable will be retinal function. Retinal function tests are included as the retina is a specifically differentiated neural tissue and therefore represents an accessible window into the functioning of the brain. The overall purpose of this public-health research is to help define a simple and effective dietary intervention aimed at maintaining cognitive and retinal function in later life. This is the first trial of its kind aiming to slow the decline of cognitive and retinal function in older people by increasing daily dietary intake of n-3 LCPs. The link between cognitive ability, visual function and quality of life among older people suggests that this novel line of research may have considerable public health importance.\n\nStudy hypotheses:\n1. For healthy, cognitively normal adults aged 70-79 years of age, daily supplementation with n-3 LCPs (500 mg DHA and 200 mg EPA) will slow the rate, or delay the onset, of cognitive decline.\n2. For healthy, cognitively normal adults aged 70-79 years of age, daily supplementation with n-3 LCPs (500 mg DHA and 200 mg EPA) will improve visual function by enhancing rod photoreceptor response to light and visual-cortical integration.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.

To date, this treatment has usually been carried out in hospital, where research has already shown it to be effective. Programs typically last for 6 weeks, but improvements persist much longer. For maximum benefit patients must be assisted to change their lifestyles. It is possible that the importance attached to being treated in hospital is more likely to convince patients to change their lifestyles. Alternatively, those treated in a community setting may identify the treatment more with day to day life and hence be more likely to make ongoing changes. This study randomises patients to receive their rehabilitation program in either hospital or community setting to see if one is superior to the other.
