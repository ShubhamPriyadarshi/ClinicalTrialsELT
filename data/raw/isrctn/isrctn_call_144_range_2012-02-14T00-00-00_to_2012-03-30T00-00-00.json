For example, if a patient is focusing on a low salt diet, only the item assessing this self-care behaviour will be retained.\n2. Confidence to change will be measured using the Questionnaire of Health Belief. The first subscale, an 8-item questionnaire, uses a 5-point Likert scale to measure the perception of barriers to change. A higher score indicates a higher level of confidence, or fewer barriers.\n3. Confidence specific to heart failure patients will be measured using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index Section C. This is a 6-item questionnaire which uses a 4-point Likert scale to measure confidence in respecting self-care. A higher score indicates a higher level of confidence.\n4. Conviction to change will be measured using the Questionnaire of Health Belief second subscale. This is a 4-item questionnaire which uses a 5-point Likert scale to measure the perception of benefits to change. A higher score indicates fewer benefits.\n5. Acceptability of the intervention will be measured using the Treatment Acceptability and Preference Questionnaire. This is a 4-item questionnaire which uses a 5-point Likert scale to measure the patients' opinion of the acceptability of a treatment. A higher score indicates greater acceptability of the treatment. An overall satisfaction question is also asked.\n6. Feasibility of the intervention will be assessed by documenting the number of patients who: \n6.1 Are eligible\n6.2. Agree to participate in the study\n6.3. Remain in the study one month after randomisation\n7.

The patients were first informed about the study by letter and then contacted by telephone by the head investigator or by the chief physician of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of the Oulu University Hospital. \n\nThe participants were randomly assigned to two groups on the day of their discharge. The active group (AG) participated in the MRP 2 - 4 months after TKA, and the control group (CG) followed usual orthopaedic care. Follow-up assessments were performed in both groups at 2, 6 and 12 months after TKA. \n\n1. Usual orthopaedic care: \nAll the participants received usual orthopaedic care. Preoperative exercises (use of crutches; simple mobility exercises for the lower limbs; maintenance of cardiovascular fitness) were recommended to all the participants by a physiotherapist when the decision of surgery was made. An outpatient control visit to an orthopedic surgeon was made 2, 6 and 12 months after TKA. The need for further rehabilitation was assessed at each control visit. No attempt to interfere with usual care was made. Thus, a series of outpatient physiotherapy or other rehabilitation interventions might have been included in the usual care during the study period. \n\nOn the surgical ward, an exercise program tailored to the needs and status of the patient was taught perioperatively to all the participants by a physiotherapist. The programme was comprised of simple exercises to retrain lower-limb strength and lower-limb joint mobility. Advice on ice application was given. Functional exercises included transfers, gait training, and stair climbing. A subsequent exercise program was recommended to each outpatient by a physiotherapist at the 2-month outpatient control visit. It was comprised of walking without sticks, further lower-limb strengthening, and joint mobility exercises. \n\n2. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation program:\nThe MRP in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the Oulu University Hospital was completed as an outpatient course lasting 10 days. Each course consisted of up to 8 participants. The aim of the MRP was to improve the participants' coping with the activities of daily living, including improvement of lower-limb strength, increase of lower-limb joint mobility, improvement of endurance and cardiovascular fitness, and reinforcement of coping strategies. Further objectives were motivating the participants to carry out a regular exercise programme and weight control or weight reduction. The final aim of the MRP was psychosocial recreation, especially through peer support. \n\nOn the first day of the MRP the physiatrist verified each participant's eligibility in the course. Two physiotherapists supervised the participants in all the courses, and each participant was also individually assessed (30 and 45 minutes). Three group sessions (45 minutes/session), which included supervision of strengthening exercises for the lower limbs and focused on knee and ankle extensors and flexors, were included in the first week. Two similar sessions were included in the second week. In the first week there were two water gymnastic sessions (30 minutes/session), including supervision of stretching and mobility exercises for the lower limbs, with functional exercises focused on walking. Three similar but longer-lasting (40 minutes) sessions were included in the second week. Stretching exercises were supervised in a daily group (30 minutes/session). Nordic walking, representing functional exercises, was supervised twice a week in an outdoor activity group (30 minutes). Four supervised group rehearsals of relaxation strategies were included (30 minutes/session) in the MRP. \n\nTwo group sessions (90 minutes/session; 1 session/week) supervised by a psychologist were included, and in the second week each participant visited a psychologist. The aim of the sessions was to support the participants' coping strategies. In the first week a social worker gave a lecture (60 minutes) concerning social benefits and community services, and a nutritionist gave a lecture (90 minutes) concerning healthy nutrition and weight control. In the second week an orthopaedic surgeon lectured (45 minutes) about TKA and clinically assessed each participant (15 minutes). \n\nMRP courses following the protocol described above have been used as an intensive rehabilitation intervention for selected patients with a high risk of poor outcome after TKA or total hip arthroplasty (THA) at the Oulu University Hospital since 2000. \n\nOf the 144 patients, 88 patients were selected to proceed in the 12-month follow-up.

Metacognitive therapy will be superior to waitlist and exposure in reducing worry and negative beliefs about thoughts.\n4. Improvements in memory will be associated with improvements in symptoms in the two treatment conditions (a test of memory based models).\n5. Reductions in worry will be associated with improvements in symptoms in the two treatment conditions.\n6. Reductions in negative beliefs about thoughts will be associated with improvements in symptoms.\n7. Changes in beliefs about thoughts will be a better predictor of treatment outcome than changes in memory.\n\nParticipants:\nParticipants will be identified by screening the Psychology waiting lists at the Manchester Mental Health & Social Care Trust; Bolton, Salford & Trafford Mental Health Trust and Pennine Care NHS Trust. These individuals will be awaiting treatment for PTSD. Participants will be deemed suitable if they are between the ages of 18-65, meet diagnostic (DSM\u2212IV) criteria for PTSD, have PTSD as the primary problem and have been experiencing PTSD symptoms for more than three months. Three months as the length of time between the trauma and treatment has been chosen as a cutoff point due to a high spontaneous recovery rate prior to three months.\n\nMethod:\nPatients will be sent an information letter and consent form advising them of the content of the study and inviting them to the contact the investigator should they wish to take part. At recruitment, participants will be asked if they require a summary of the findings and, if so, contact details will be taken specifically for this purpose and stored in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office. As the research is using a randomised controlled trial design with three conditions, participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three conditions (metacognitive therapy, exposure therapy, waiting list controls) after the initial assessment session has been completed. A randomised controlled trial has been chosen to reduce variables which may affect the outcome of treatment other than the treatment itself and to allow an adequate comparison between the three conditions. The random allocation to conditions will not be undertaken by the principle researcher to avoid bias. The three conditions include two treatment conditions - metacognitive therapy for PTSD core treatment (11 sessions), exposure therapy (11 sessions) or a waiting list control condition followed by individualised treatment using the manualised metacognitive therapy for PTSD core treatment (11 sessions). Manualised packages for both treatment conditions have been chosen to reduce variations between therapist and participant interactions, therefore enabling a more accurate evaluation of the results. The control condition is required to establish if the treatment is more beneficial than time itself. There will be follow-ups at three and six months post treatment for all three conditions. This is to establish if the treatment has an effect beyond the time period of contact with the therapist. Self report measures, assessor measures and an independent assessor will be used to reduce bias. If, following treatment patients are still experiencing distress they will remain on the waiting list for treatment as usual. The departments from which the participants will be recruited have been involved in discussions regarding the benefits of this research. The waiting list time at the departments is up to twelve months and therefore it is very beneficial for participants to take part in the research as they would otherwise have a long waiting time for treatment. They will be receiving treatment within two to four months (maximum) if they enter the study. Assuming ethical approval has been gained, it is anticipated that assessments will begin in 04/07. Interventions will begin in 06/07 and continue until 01/08. During this period, monthly meetings will take place with the study supervisor. Follow-up assessments will be completed within the following six months, alongside data analysis and report writing.

Weight loss improves many features of asthma. Whilst lung function will improve with weight loss as a result of mechanical work, it is difficult to explain improvements in bronchial hyper-reactivity and airway inflammation purely on a mechanical basis. Obesity is associated with a state of immune activation that could amplify the process of autoimmunity.\n\nWe hypothesize that immunological mechanisms partly account for the relationship between obesity and asthma. More specifically, we propose that increased concentrations of the adipokines leptin and tumour necrosis factor alpha and reduced concentrations of adiponectin in obese subjects are promoters of inflammation in asthma, and that improvements in asthma with weight loss are related to changes in the systemic and local (within the bronchial tree) concentrations of these factors as well as a reduction in mechanical work.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Expected weight loss in the intensive group of 10 to 12 kg (10 - 20% body weight), compared to minimal weight loss in the conventional group.

This will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of aldosterone inhibition with spironolactone in 200 patients with mild chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 40-80 ml/min). Following informed consent, all patients will be entered into active run-in phase consisting of spironolactone 25 mg daily for 4 weeks. This will allow an early evaluation of patient safety and tolerability. Patients will have blood samples on day zero and at weeks 1, 2  and 4 to monitor serum potassium and renal function. In the event of hyperkalaemia, or any other adverse event, patients will be either withdrawn or tried on a lower dose of spironolactone. Patients tolerating spironolactone for 4 weeks will be randomised to receive spironolactone 25 mg (or a lower dose) or matching placebo for a further 36 weeks. Patients  will continue to take the rest of their medications as usual.  Over 40 weeks there will be 3 main visits to the Renal Unit and 5 very short visits. We will try and combine these visits with any existing Outpatient Appointments. \n\nThe end-points of the study will be:\n- Left ventricular mass by echocardiography (and magnetic resonance imaging in a subset of patients).\n- Left ventricular systolic and diastolic function by echocardiography\n- Arterial stiffness by pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity\n- Heart rate variability by 24-hour ECG recordings\n- Blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\nThe 5 short visits (to see the Study Nurse) will be for a simple blood test (5 ml; 1 teaspoon) to monitor blood potassium levels and should take no longer than 10 minutes. The 3 main visits will each last approximately 2 hours. They will happen right at the beginning, after 4 weeks and at the end of the study. The first thirty minutes will be spent resting in a quiet temperature controlled room. An echocardiogram will then be performed. Following this patients will have their blood pressure taken. Patients will then have their arterial stiffness measured by taking their pulse at the radial artery (augmentation index), carotid and femoral arteries (pulse wave velocity) with a tonometer, which looks like a pen. This takes approximately 15 minutes. After this endothelial function will be measured in the skin circulation. This is done by applying extremely small amounts of drugs (acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside) onto the skin that dilate blood vessels. The increased blood flow through the skin is measured by using a monitor applied to the finger tip.  This whole process takes about 30 minutes. After this a blood test is taken. An extra 10 ml (2 tablespoons) of blood is taken to measure the concentrations of aldosterone and other hormones (angiotensin II, renin) as well as markers of inflammation (CRP and 8-isoprostane). Before leaving the renal unit three ECG (heart monitor) leads are attached to the patient's chest. These are connected to a heart monitor that fits into a little pocket that can be attached to a belt. A 24-hour blood pressure monitor will also be fitted. These will be worn  for the next 24 hours. At the end of the 2 hours the patient will leave the renal unit. There will be no side-effects or discomfort from any of the measurements made and the patient should therefore be able to get on with the rest of their day as normal. Arrangements will be made for collection of the 24-hour ECG and blood pressure monitors.\nSome of the patients will be asked to attend on two further visits of about 30 minutes each at the start and end of the study. These will be to allow as to perform a cardiac magnetic resonance study. This is a special scan of the heart which will allow us to make a more detailed and accurate measurements of the heart. It will involve lying down on a table which is then pushed into the scanner that looks like a small tunnel. The whole process takes about 15 minutes. No X-rays are used and there is therefore no exposure to radiation. A small amount of contrast will be injected into a vein.  Efforts will be made to time these extra visits with either other study visits or clinic visits to minimise inconvenience. After the third  main visit the spironolactone or placebo tablets will be stopped and there will be no further visits or tests to be done.

As a consequence many patients only need anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid injections into their joints. There is evidence that some patients with psoriatic arthritis have a more severe disease. They can become quite disabled and their joints damaged. As a consequence rheumatologists are keen to treat patients with more severe disease with disease modifying drugs, in particular a drug called methotrexate. This is the most effective drug of its class when used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It also improves the skin in psoriasis. At present there is insufficient evidence that it works in psoriatic arthritis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with methotrexate is effective in psoriatic arthritis. It will determine if methotrexate reduces disease activity and improves function in patients whose disease is severe enough for their rheumatologist to consider using a disease modifying drug. The MIPA study will compare the effect of methotrexate against a placebo in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The trial will assess their function over six months.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Not provided at time of registration", "secondaryOutcome":
