Recent imaging studies on RA have demonstrated that the structural progression observed in patients in clinical remission might be explained by the persistency of a subclinical signs of synovitis detected by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography (US). In particular, Power-Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS), which measures the amount of intrarticular blood flow, has been demonstrated to be a valid and reliable tool in detecting subclinical inflammation in RA, and it is believed to be an objective measure of activity of joint inflammation. \n\nHowever, only a few uncontrolled studies have tested the effect of CS on US-detected joint inflammation, showing rapid improvement of US-detected synovial inflammation after intra-articular and intravenous CS treatment in established RA.\n\nAt present there is no evidence about the effect of low dose oral CS on the US-detected synovial inflammation.\n\nThis study aimed to verify, in patients with recent-onset RA, the effect of low doses of oral prednisone on clinical and US outcomes over 12 months of follow-up.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.
