Central elements are: psychoeducation, support, problem solving, pleasant activities, activity scheduling by using pedometers, thought control techniques, cognitive restructuring, Socratic dialogue, social skills and interpersonal contact training, crisis intervention, emergency planning. \n\nThe guided self-help intervention 'Successful aging with Diabetes' (SH) with a focus on living and ageing with diabetes will be delivered by trained moderators (elderly care nurses, nurses or others). Moderators should pay attention, be empathetic and give support to all patients. The guided self-help intervention will provide an intact community and a sense of belonging, thus controlling for unspecific group effects due to the participation in a social network of people sharing the same problems which may reduce social or emotional isolation. The moderators should promote reciprocal caring and the sharing of relevant information regarding diabetes and ageing. The primary value of this group condition will be the mutual aid offered by members to one another. Therefore no formal therapeutic aspects will be involved and moderators should restrict their function to guide the group and give support. The Cognitive Behavioural Therapy intervention is based on a manualised programme, whereas only recommendations are given to the moderators for SH groups. Primarily patients decide about the topics or group activities. Thematically the intervention modules will be comparable to programmes of German self-help groups, comprising spontaneous conversation or several group activities. \n\nThe participants of the TAU group and their treating physician will receive diagnostic feedback regarding the minor or mild depression symptoms and cognitive function. Furthermore a feed-back on the therapeutic options will be given to the physicians if minor or mild depression symptoms are diagnosed. For minor depression or depressive symptoms on a subclinical level the following treatment options including their combination are generally possible: \n1. 'watchful waiting' (to await the spontaneous remission of the disorder) \n2. Psychotherapy and/or physical activity \n3. Currently, there is no scientific evidence for medical treatment with antidepressents in elderly diabetes patients with minor depression, but a treatment attempt with a well-tolerated antidepressant (e.g., sertraline, citalopram) could be an optional medical intervention \n\nThe review of current clinical trials for treating minor depression is undetermined. Currently no medical guidelines exist for treating minor depression or depressive symptoms on a subclinical level. Hence, in this TAU group the respective treating physician has to decide if a patient will get antidepressant medication, psychotherapeutic interventions or treatment as usual awaiting the course of depressive symptoms. \n\nTotal duration of interventions: 15 months (one session per week for 12 weeks, then 1 session per month for 12 months)", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2009 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570236 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "3568b69c-5b14-4c85-b8a4-6e6f0e61a5d4", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2009-07-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570236"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18604-0", "contactId": "Contact56595_18604", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55169"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56595_18604", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Frank", "surname": "Petrak", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "LWL-Klinik Dortmund\nUniversit\u00e4tsklinik der Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum\nAbteilung f\u00fcr Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie \nc/o Schulberg 7-9", "city": "Wiesbaden", "country": "Germany", "zip": "65183", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55169", "organisation": "Ruhr University of Bochum (Germany)", "website": "http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/psy-som-do/", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "c/o Prof. Dr. Frank Petrak\nLWL-Klinik Dortmund\nUniversit\u00e4tsklinik der Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum \nAbteilung f\u00fcr Psychosomatische Medizin und Psychotherapie \nc/o Schulberg 7-9", "city": "Wiesbaden", "country": "Germany", "zip": "65183", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.5570.7", "rorId": "https://ror.org/04tsk2644"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder18604-0", "name": "Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Germany)", "fundRef": "http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347"}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-07-30T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "22", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2009-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "61531337"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Choosing the most efficient and cost-effective treatment for acute whiplash associated disorders (WAD)", "scientificTitle": "A randomised three-group study, internet-based, face-to-face based and standard-management after acute whiplash associated disorders (WAD): choosing the most efficient and cost-effective treatment", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "The main purpose of this study is to try a new intervention strategy aimed to reduce the number of patients who have persistent problems after the whiplash injury.

It provides sufficient anaesthesia for grafts to be taken without any supplemental anaesthetic agent. Reports suggest the application of EMLA cream may result in variations in skin thickness. This change in skin thickness may have significant consequences on the subsequent graft taken. The aim of this study is to assess histologically the effect of EMLA cream on the thickness of split skin grafts taken and the effects of local anaesthetics on skin culture.\n\nMethods\nA randomised controlled trial will be performed to assess the thickness of split skin grafts taken using EMLA cream and the effect of local anaesthetic on cell culture. The investigators, who will provide verbal and written information regarding the trial, will approach patients. If the patient agrees to participate written consent will be obtained. \n\nMaterials\nEMLA cream, occlusive dressings, lidocaine\n\nPreoperative Preparation\nThe operating surgeon will mark the abdomen for the abdominoplasty procedure. The surgeon, will then offer the patient envelopes in order to randomise EMLA to either the right or left side of the abdominoplasty. The cream will then be applied and an occlusive dressing applied at least 2 hours prior to surgery.\n\nIntraoperative Procedure\nIn theatre, the occlusive dressing and cream will removed from the abdomen. Lignocaine will be injected under the skin on the other side of the abdomen. The dermatome will be used to harvest the split skin grafts. The dermatome thickness will be adjusted so three grafts of varying thickness will be taken on across the abdomen (4, 8, 12 /1000th of an inch). Six core biopsies (6mm in diameter) will be taken from the edge of the donor sites. These specimens will then placed in formalin to fix\nthe tissue for analysis be forwarded to the histopathology department for histological analysis. A further three core biopsies from each area will be taken for cell culture. These will be wrapped in saline soaked gauze, and sent in plain sterile containers carefully labelled to the skin laboratory. The abdominoplasty procedure will continue as normal following excision of the unwanted abdominal skin. Postoperatively, the patient will require no further follow-up from the study investigators and no long term consequences from the study are anticipated as the skin used would have been discarded anyway.\n\nHistological Assessment\nCore biopsies will be taken from the edges of the donor sites to include adjacent normal skin. This method will allow analysis of the thickness of skin removed. Once this analysis has been performed and results recorded, the specimens will be destroyed. Photographs of histological findings with all patient identifiers removed may be used in the publication of results.\n\nCell culture Assessment\nUsing standardised cell culture techniques, the skin biopsies from each area of local anaesthetic and control will be cultured. Cell counts will be performed for keratinocytes and fibroblasts at the appropriate intervals.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe skin thicknesses for the EMLA and control specimens will then be analysed for statistical significance as discussed with the Trust statistician.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "EMLA cream, lidocaine"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2008 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024250 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "9594c550-f3a5-469d-acc9-51f96c6473fb", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2008-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024250"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder15626-0", "contactId": "Contact53559_15626", "sponsorId": "Sponsor52106"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact53559_15626", "title": "Mr", "forename": "JD", "surname": "Nancarrow", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Burns & Plastics\nSelly Oak Hospital", "city": "Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B29 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor52106", "organisation": "Record Provided by the NHSTCT Register - 2006 Update - Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "The Department of Health, Richmond House, 79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder15626-0", "name": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (UK), NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "19", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2006-04-28T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "68236655"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Effects of a pain consult and patient education and monitoring: a prospective study in oncology patients", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "It is hypothesised that a pain consult at the specialized pain clinic in combination with Patient Education Program is more effective in reducing average pain intensity compared to a pain consult alone.

When associated with iron deficiency, anaemia may impair mental and motor development. There are indications that with iron therapy anaemic children fail to catch up to non-anaemic children. Primary prevention of iron deficiency and malaria in young children could have substantive effect on reducing child mortality and morbidity. \nKey strategies for the reduction of infant anaemia are: iron supplementation in pregnancy and infancy; iron-fortification of infant formula; chemoprophylaxis and prompt anti-malarial treatment in pregnancy and infancy; and use of insecticide-treated nets to reduce exposure to malaria. Combinations of the aforementioned strategies can synergistically improve anaemia. However, most have had limited success in developing countries due to financial, logistic and technical constraints. \nIn view of this there is interest in improving the iron status of infants by enhancing their red cell mass with late umbilical cord clamping.

The curriculum is embedded within a comprehensive and ongoing initiative that includes: schoolwide activities to promote positive relationships and prevent violence and abuse; information sharing with parents to encourage positive adolescent choices in these areas; exposure to community resources that promote healthy adolescent choices; school-wide campaigns related to substance use, sexual behaviour and violence; and training for all school personnel.
