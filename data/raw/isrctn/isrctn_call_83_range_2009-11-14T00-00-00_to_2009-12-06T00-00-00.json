Accordingly, a physician not involved in data collection or patient-assessment, will prepare 64 sealed non-transparent envelopes, each reporting a code number and containing a sheet of paper reporting \"Morphine\" or \"Block\". The envelopes will be in a free deposit box in the office of the operative suite. The investigator administering morphine or performing the block will be the same and he will know the patient assignment after the induction of anaesthesia. At the end of surgery, the skin where the block was performed will be covered by plaster so the observer of the recovery period, not involved in the anaesthesia or aware of the patient group assignment, could not distinguish the technique used. The physician responsible for randomisation will maintain concealed the codes until the end of the study.\n\nAll patients enrolled will receive a standardised general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia monitoring will include electrocardiograms (ECG) (five derivations), invasive blood pressure measurement, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), train-of-four (TOF), Bispectral Index (BIS). Anaesthesia will be induced thought peripheral vein; after pre-oxygenation with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) 1 through facial mask (3 minutes), remifentanil infusion (0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min) will be started and, after 5 minutes, a bolus of propofol (0.2 mg/kg intravenous [iv]) followed by cisatracurium (0.1 mg/kg iv) will be administered. The dosing of drugs will be calculated on the ideal weight (Broca formula): for man = height (cm) - 100; for woman = height (cm) - 104.\n\nAfter tracheal intubation, patients will be mechanically ventilated with FiO2 0.5 in air, tidal volume 6 - 8 ml/kg, respiratory rate 12/min. General anaesthesia will be maintained with remifentanil and propofol infusion according to the required depth of anaesthesia. \n\nBefore starting surgery, the investigator will open the envelop containing the randomisation code, so patients will be assigned to one of the following two groups:\nGroup B: receive a superficial cervical block with levobupivacaine 7.5% 10 ml after induction of anaesthesia and before the surgical incision\nGroup M: morphine will be administered 30 minutes before the end of surgery, in a dose of 0.15 mg/kg iv in patients aged less than or equal to 75 age or 0.10 mg/kg in patients over 75 age.\nThe observer who will perform the post-operative assessment of the patient will not be involved in the anaesthesia or aware of the patient group assignment. About 60 minutes before the end of surgery, acetaminophen 1 g will be administered intravenously in 15 minutes to both groups. At the end of surgical operation, the decurarisation with prostigmine and atropine will be performed according to the TOF value and then the infusion of propofol and remifentanil will be interrupted (time T0). \n\nIn the recovery period, Aldrete score will be measured at 0, 5, 10, and 30 minutes after extubation.

This initial combination, if tolerated, was continued for 3 months. If the clinical improvement at 3 months was under 50% in at least two of the three criteria (swollen joints, tender joints, and ESR or CRP), the respective doses of methotrexate and prednisolone were increased to 10 mg weekly and 7.5 mg daily. The protocol allowed flexible subsequent dose adjustment to mimic clinical practice. Thus, the highest dose at 9 months and thereafter was 2 g daily for sulphasalazine, 15 mg weekly for methotrexate, 300 mg daily for hydroxychloroquine, and 10 mg daily for prednisolone. If a patient reached remission during the first year with initial combination, the drug doses were tapered, and prednisolone and methotrexate could even be discontinued at 9 months and 18 months, respectively. Sulphasalazine (1 g daily), and hydroxychloroquine (300 mg daily) had to be continued for 2 years. In the patients who reached remission during the first year, but not with the initial combination, the drug doses were gradually tapered to those of the second year. If the induced remission was lost, the DMARD doses were increased with the intention of reaching remission. If one or several components of the combination had to be discontinued for any reason, a combination of three DMARDs was restarted by replacing sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine with auranofin (3 - 6 mg daily), and methotrexate with azathioprine (2 mg/kg daily). Other DMARDs could also be used as substitutes.\n\nThe single-treatment strategy was also targeted to achieve remission. The simultaneous use of oral prednisolone up to 10 mg was allowed in patients with continuously active disease, but simultaneous use of multiple DMARDs was not allowed. The decision to use prednisolone was made by the treating physician. The patients were treated continuously with one DMARD alone, with or without prednisolone. If a more beneficial effect was needed, the dose was increased or the DMARD was changed. Sulphasalazine (2 g daily) was used as the initial drug in all patients, and the dose was increase to 3 g daily at 3 months, if clinically indicated. If an adverse event occurred, or if the clinical response was less than 25% at 6 months, the protocol required that sulphasalazine was replaced with methotrexate 87.5 mg - 15 mg weekly).\n\nIntraarticular injections of glucocorticoids into inflamed joints were allowed in both treatment arms. \n\nAll the patients were clinically assessed at baseline and at months 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 24 and the adjusments of drug doses were performed. \n\nAfter two years, treatment was still aimed at achieving or maintaining remissions, but the choise and use of DMARDs was unrestricted. Thus, regardless of the original randomisation group, patients who had an insufficient response could be treated liberally with increased dosages of DMARDs (methotrexate up to 25 mg/week) and with

Review of nurse/paramedic decision making by independent clinical panel\n7. Economic analysis of findings. The findings indicate that the provision of telephone assessment and advice to Category C callers is both safe and acceptable to callers. Telephone assessment and advice could enable patients with no identified clinical need for an emergency ambulance to be offered more appropriate care for their presenting condition. In the ambulance services studied, this could lead to at least 7-10% of dispatches being cancelled, so enabling improved response times for patients with more critical or life-threatening needs.

The second group (control group) will not receive additional sedation.\n\nThe patients will be visited before the operation and the technique explained to them. Two anaesthetists will be present during the procedure (anaesthetist A and anaesthetist B). In the anaesthetic room an intravenous cannula will be inserted and a spinal block performed using a 25 gauge needle and 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.\n\nFive patients will be randomly allocated into the sevoflurane or placebo (oxygen/air) group (25 in each). All patients will receive 2 l/min oxygen/air mixture from the anaesthetic machine through nasal cannulae. The anaesthetic machine will be covered so that only anaesthetist A will be able to see the sevoflurane vaporiser. He will add a fixed percentage of sevoflurane (at the moment thought to be 1-2%, but may need to be greater) to the fresh gas flow for patients allocated to the sedation group. The vaporiser will remain turned off for the non-sedation group.\n\nAnaesthetist B will be responsible for assessing levels of sedation at all points during the anaesthetic and recovery phase. This will involve several well recognised psychomotor tests, including the Ramsay Sedation Scale, Trieger's adaptation of the Bender Motor Gestalt Test, and also a tapping test and ball bearing test as used by previous investigators including Short and Galletly. Before anaesthesia, Anaesthetist B will explain the test to the patient. The patient will be visited three times after the operation. First on the recovery ward, and later on the main ward at 4 h and 24 h after the operation. During these visits, the Trieger, tapping and ball bearing tests will be repeated and the patient will be asked to give a satisfaction rating based on a 10-cm visual analogue scale.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Sevoflurane"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder5660-0", "contactId": "Contact6735_5660", "sponsorId": "Sponsor5287"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact6735_5660", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Gilbert R", "surname": "Park", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Box 17\nJohn Farman Intensive Care Unit\nAddenbrooke's NHS Trust\nHills Road", "city": "Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB2 2QQ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)1223 217433"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "gilbertpark@doctors.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor5287", "organisation": "Department of Health (UK)", "website": "http://www.doh.gov.uk", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder5660-0", "name": "Cambridge Consortium - Addenbrookes (UK)", "fundRef": null}}]}}
