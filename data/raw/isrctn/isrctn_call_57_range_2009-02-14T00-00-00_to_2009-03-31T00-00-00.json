We also placed inline foot switches (Noraxon Inc., USA) with two sensors on each, on the plantar surface of the shoes in the toe and heel positions. Foot-switch data collection was time-synchronized with the kinematic data through the Vicon-Peak\u00ae digital transceiver. The signals provided from the foot-switches were used to determine the exact time occurrences of the start and the end of the pivoting period that was under evaluation. Based on our hypothesis, the dependent variable examined in the present study was the range of motion of tibial rotation during the pivoting period for the two examined tasks.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18449-0", "contactId": "Contact56440_18449", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55013"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56440_18449", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Anastasios", "surname": "Georgoulis", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "University of Ioannina\nMedical School\nOAKI\nGeorgiou Papandreou 2", "city": "Ioannina", "country": "Greece", "zip": "45221", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "oaki@cc.uoi.gr"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55013", "organisation": "University of Ioannina (Greece)", "website": "http://www.uoi.gr", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Medical School \nP.O.

Bone marrow stem cells (BMS cells) have been shown to be able to transdifferentiate to male germ cell-like cells. In male mice, a recent study has demonstrated that bone marrow stem cells are able to differentiate into primordial germ cells and spermatogonia both in vitro and in vivo. \n \nIn a more recent study, adult bone marrow cells injected into seminiferous tubules or interstitial spaces were not only able to differentiate into germ cells (spermatogonia and spermatocytes) but as well as Sertoli and Leydig cells. This finding may be of clinical relevance to unique treatment of male infertility. The ability to derive male germ cells from BMS cells opens the possibilities for use of these cells in reproductive medicine mainly male infertility. In order to encourage BMS cells to differentiate into germ cells, the isolated cells should be cultured in a medium very similar to that found in the testes.

This is probably the result of the shoulder anatomy that predisposes to instability. There are several methods of reduction of the anterior dislocation of the shoulder, including those introduced by Hippocrates, Kocher Milch and Stimpson; rates of success and complications following reduction range according to the method used. Although most anterior shoulder dislocations can be easily reduced at the Accident and Emergency Departments (AE) of most hospitals, some dislocations will still require the implementation of more than one method(s) and in 5% to 10% of cases, reduction can only be achieved at an operating theatre. \n\nThe optimal method of reduction should require minimal assistance to the physician performing it and it ought to be highly effective, quick, safe and painless. Choosing which method to use is a whole different issue, since most physicians seldom base their decision on objective criteria. This however is more or less expected since there are only a few studies in the literature that compare the efficacy, safety and reliability among different techniques and most of them are lacking comparison groups, blinded methodology, or proper statistical analysis. \n\nThis trial compares the efficacy of the FARES (FAst REliable Safe) method, a new method to reduce shoulder dislocation, against two traditional methods (\"Hippocrates\" and \"Kocher\" methods).", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Efficacy of each individual method as far as the reduction of the shoulder dislocation was concerned.

A cluster randomised controlled trial", "acronym": "HIPS", "studyHypothesis": "Healthy children are felt to be an important source for community transmission of influenza. Immunising healthy school-aged children, who mount a robust immune response to the vaccine, has been proposed as one strategy to protect high risk individuals. By immunising children, spread of influenza is prevented and persons at high risk for complications are protected. Although observational data are supportive, a randomised controlled trial is needed to test whether such a strategy provides indirect benefit. Many challenges exist to carefully assessing the indirect benefit of influenza immunisation, including the feasibility of extensive laboratory testing in large clusters of high risk persons in towns and cities, the problem of repeated introduction of influenza in a community, and the uncertain uniformity and nature of interactions between healthy children and individuals at high risk for complications of influenza. Hutterites, along with the Mennonites, were founded as Protestant sects in the 16th century Anabaptist movement of Switzerland. The majority of Hutterites live in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba where they practice communal farming on small colonies relatively isolated from towns and cities. Randomisation of these homogeneous, moderately sized colonies where regular influenza transmission is facilitated by a communal lifestyle, but where there is limited re-introduction of the virus because of isolation from the outside community, represents a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis of indirect benefit.                              \n\nWe hypothesise that if greater than or equal to 70% of healthy children in intervention colonies are immunised with inactivated vaccine, laboratory-confirmed influenza in other Hutterite colony members will be reduced. Specific objectives of the proposed cluster randomised trial are to assess whether high immunisation rates among healthy children in Hutterite colonies reduces laboratory-confirmed influenza in other colony members, high risk participants (including the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, and young children), or healthy immunised children, as well as whether the intervention reduces the following among all participants: \n1.

G10: \"mono-therapy with injection or thermal coagulation is an effective haemostatic technique for high-risk stigmata; but, the combination is superior to either alone\", and G17: that \"an intravenous bolus followed by continuous-infusion proton-pump inhibitor is effective in decreasing rebleeding in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy\". Adherence to G10 and G17 is defined as the proportion of patients with bleeding ulcers exhibiting high risk stigmata (active bleeding, visible vessel, and adherent clots) treated endoscopically with injection followed by thermal therapy and who thereafter also receive an IV PPI for a correct indication at a correct dosing (high dose pantoprazole 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/hour following the endoscopic therapy for a total of 72 hours (both \u00b112 hours), in patients undergoing successful endoscopic haemostasis for a high risk bleeding ulcer). As part of a pre-planned sensitivity analysis, the endoscopic therapy criterion will be broadened to accept performance of successful endoscopic haemostasis using either thermal or clips application alone, in keeping with persistent controversy and evolving data. The pharmacotherapy criterion is the definition of appropriate use we adopted in the nation-wide DURABLE audit of in-hospital PPI prescribing.", "secondaryOutcome": "1. Adherence to the different guidelines are defined as follows: \n1.1. To G10 or G17 alone (an additional definition will assess adherence of G17 with administration of both bolus and infusion for correct indications and durations, but at incorrect dosing levels, and segregate incorrect dosing errors into underuse and overuse)\n1.2. To G5b: \"Early stratification of patients into low- and high-risk categories for rebleeding and mortality, based on clinical/endoscopic criteria, is important for proper management. Available prognostic scales may be used to assist in decision-making\", as identification of a recorded Rockall score in the patient chart. \n1.3. To G6: \"Early endoscopy (in the first 24 hours) with risk classification by clinical/endoscopic criteria allows for safe and prompt discharge of patients classified as low risk; improves patient outcomes for high-risk patients; and reduces resource utilisation for patients classified as either low or high risk\", as the performance of endoscopy within 24 hours of onset of presentation to the emergency room (or of onset of symptoms for in-patients)\n1.4. A review of the endoscopic records will assess the correct decision as to the performance of endoscopic therapy or not according to the guidelines 7: \n1.4.1. G7a: \"A finding of low-risk endoscopic stigmata (a clean-based ulcer or a non-protuberant pigmented dot in an ulcer bed) is not an indication for endoscopic haemostatic therapy\"\n1.4.2. G7b: \"A finding of a clot in an ulcer bed warrants targeted irrigation in an attempt at dislodgment, with appropriate treatment of the underlying lesion\"\n1.4.3. G7c: \"A finding of high-risk endoscopic stigmata (active bleeding or a visible vessel in an ulcer bed) is an indication for immediate endoscopic haemostatic therapy\", regardless of the chosen method\n1.5. G18: \"In patients awaiting endoscopy, empirical therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor should be considered\", for which any dose or method of administration is acceptable as per the guideline\n\nTertiary endpoints: \nMore traditional, clinical endpoints of continued bleeding or rebleeding, need for surgery and mortality will be assessed, using previously validated clinical definitions. Continued bleeding is defined as:\n1. Spurting arising from an artery on initial endoscopic examination not responding to endoscopic therapy\n2. Persistence following initial endoscopy of bloody nasogastric aspirate\n3. Shock with a pulse greater than 100 beats/min, a systolic blood pressure of under 100 mmHg, or both; and/or \n4. The need for substantial replacement of blood and fluid volume (transfusion of greater than 3 units of blood within 4 hours) following endoscopic therapy\n5. The proportion of rebleeding (defined by recurrent vomiting of fresh blood, melena, or both with either shock or a decrease in haemoglobin concentration of at least 2 g/L following initial successful treatment including resuscitation and endoscopic therapy, if  indicated) will be quantified, as will the need for surgery and mortality\n6. Economic data will be captured in the form of duration of hospital stay and converted into hospitalisation costs based on Canadian per diem we have published\n7.

A number of aspects of the intervention are innovative and are detailed below:\n1. Determination of barriers: we carried out a careful analysis of existing barriers to the uptake of guidelines in NVUGIB nationally, allowing us to identify specific corresponding strategies\n2. Tailored nature of the intervention: tailoring of the multifaceted intervention to a given institution's needs will include any combination or all of the above strategies, based on responses to a needs questionnaire administered at baseline to clusters receiving the intervention (also allowing a priori adjustment of the findings)\n3. Feasibility: although elaborate in its design, the components of the intervention are simple, enhancing feasibility and favouring its wide generalisability in a real-world setting. The dissemination of the literature as pre-existing published documents, workshops and educational activities are components commonly rolled-out as part of CME-type initiatives with the proviso that the target audience be the entire health care providing team (including, for example, nurses and hospital pharmacists, not just MDs). The audit/feedback can be instated as part of ongoing quality initiatives.\n4. Process evaluation: a process evaluation is embedded in the intervention so that even if results of the evaluation will reflect its implementation as a whole, we plan to estimate the utility of its individual components on a validated 5-point Likert scale of agreement, that may have ultimately affected outcomes based on written notes taken by the staff implementing the intervention within each cluster group and a mail-out questionnaire to be sent out at the end of the study. Factors to be sought will include agreement with the guidelines, communication within each institution, amount of participation in the project, and time taken for discussions on the guidelines and their implementation, use of the components of the intervention, and length of the intervention.\n\nTiming of intervention components: \nIn order to provide initial feedback data, baseline clinical variables corresponding to primary and secondary adherence endpoints and patient outcomes for a period of care antedating the study will be collected by reviewing charts of the most recent 20 consecutive patients (20 cases + 2 independent duplicate entries for validation purposes) treated up to two months prior to randomisation. Site-specific needs and barriers distributed to intervention sites only (week 1) will assist in tailoring the strategies for each intervention site. Intervention and control site lead investigators will receive copies of the published guidelines and treatment algorithm at randomisation. Intervention site investigators will be asked to share these with the entire health care team (primary care, ER, ICU MDs, surgical and GI endoscopists, nurses, and pharmacists at their centre who care for patients with NVUGIB). \n\nThe intervention sites (not the controls) will also receive (week 2) a templated one-page report containing quantitative displays of the site's baseline profile of adherence to guidelines and patient outcomes that will also be benchmarked (with no ranking) to the amalgamated performance of intervention and control sites combined. This standardised feedback will be repeated based on follow-up clinical data collection of 23 patients at each interval, and circulated at months 4 and 8. \n\nBoth control and intervention sites will receive a final feedback report at the end of the study, at month 12. In the intervention sites during month 1, there will be two multidisciplinary guideline education sessions (two-45 minute case-based small group interactive workshops facilitated by local experts, for all members of the health care provider team, i.e.: the same primary care MDs, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists identified above), as well as distribution of the Rockall stratification scoring system. At month 4, a 2-hour collaborative care workshop will be organised with the aim of producing an institution-specific management algorithm using the published generic algorithm as initial template. Dissemination of the algorithm will be facilitated through regular meetings or e-mailing at bi-monthly intervals till the end of the study, and it will be displayed in appropriate locations of the targeted institutions in poster format. Step-wise introduction of the different strategies (even though not all sites may receive all the components) should facilitate teasing out of their incremental effect.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18043-0", "contactId": "Contact56030_18043", "sponsorId": "Sponsor54595"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56030_18043", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Alan", "surname": "Barkun", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Rm D7.185\n1650 Cedar Avenue", "city": "Montreal, Quebec", "country": "Canada", "zip": "H3G 1A4", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor54595", "organisation": "AstraZeneca Canada Inc.

Despite receiving a thorough investigation, many patients report anxiety, poor health and concerns regarding poor communication after their hospital attendance. Written factsheets have been shown to improve communication in the outpatient setting. This study will adapt these factsheets to the emergency setting and formally test them. We will give factsheets to some patients, but not others, and then compare levels of anxiety, health, chest pain symptoms, satisfaction with care, and attempts at lifestyle change. If the factsheets are beneficial for patients, we will recommend their widespread use.\n\nDuring the initial four months of the evaluation fifteen to twenty semi-structured face-to-face interviews will be undertaken with patients who have recently undergone diagnostic assessment on the CPU. Patients assessed on the CPU will be given the factsheet relevent to their condition following diagnostic evaluation and verbal communication with medical and nursing staff. Appropriate individuals will be identified and invited to participate in the study.\n\nThe interview will focus on identifying misunderstandings, inappropriate advice, and potential areas for improvement. Following analysis of the transcripts the factsheets will be adapted to take into account feedback from the interviews and ensure that they are appropriate for use in the emergency setting.\n\nPhase 2: Evaluation of the factsheets\nThe specific hypotheses outlined in the aims will be tested in a randomised controlled trial. Consecutive patients with acute chest pain who are managed on the CPU will be invited to participate in the trial.  Eligible patients will be asked to provide written, informed consent. After providing consent each patient will be randomly allocated to receive either standard verbal advice or verbal advice augmented with the written factsheet.\n\nFollow-up:\nOne month after attendance all participants will be sent a postal questionnaire consisting of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the SF-36 health-related quality of life survey, the Group Health Association of America (GHAA) Consumer Satisfaction Survey, and a brief questionnaire asking:\n1.

In order to ensure a standardised signal, each patient will use a newly calibrated Sonic Accelerated Fracture Healing System (SAFHS 2A) manufactured by Exogen (Piscataway, New Jersey). Smith & Nephew have donated all ultrasound units required for this trial. Neither the patient or the clinician will be able to adjust the ultrasound signal. To ensure reliable positioning of the SAFHS 2A unit during treatment the surgeon will insert a retaining and alignment fixture made of molded plastic into a window centered over the anteromedial surface of the cast at the site of the tibial fracture. This fixture will hold the treatment head module in place during the daily 20-minute treatment period, thus ensuring that the patient can effectively administer the treatment. After removal of the felt plug and following the application of a small amount of ultrasonic coupling gel (approximately 5 ml) to the surface of the ultrasound head, the patient will position the treatment head module in the window. The main operating unit emits a warning signal if there is not proper coupling to the skin.
