The pilot intends to recruit 20 patients.\n\nDisease information:\nPulmonary hypertension (PH) is a haemodynamic and clinic disease characterised by a progressive increase of pulmonary vascular resistance and a decrease of pulmonary vascular capacitance leading to right ventricular failure and death. It may occur in isolation (idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension) or it may be associated to a variety of systemic disorders (scleroderma, lupus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection) or cardiopulmonary pathologies such as congenital heart disease. PH is a rare condition and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension prevalence is less than 0.0001% (statistics about secondary pulmonary hypertension, 2007). Although severe pulmonary arterial hypertension is uncommon, the prognosis of these patients is life threatening and treatment options are limited.\n\nInterventions:\nA sildenafil citrate suspension developed from the crushed tablets will be compared with the powder papers usually given to the children.\n1.

When PCO reaches the central part of IOL (intraocular lens), it can induce a decrease in visual acuity after cataract surgery.

AquaLase is a new crystalline lens removal technology using the method of liquefaction of lens material by the pulses of warmed balanced salt fluid produced just inside the aspiration port of the tip. As the AquaLase tip is made of smooth rounded-bevel polymer rather than metal, the risk of capsule tears is reduced making this method more capsule friendly. Thus the lens epithelial cells (LECs) removal from the capsule bag is much easier which may be preventive for the PCO occurrence and progress. Subjective EPCO 2000 and objective OSCA are systems for computer PCO assessment. \n\nThe study is aimed at comparison of PCO extent after AquaLase and NeoSoniX cataract removal modalities using two types of software for PCO quantification, and at the comparison of these two different methods for PCO measurement. Better results in PCO for AquaLase are expected. While using this device, it is difficult to rupture the posterior capsule. Several studies have shown that the technology may have applications in polishing the capsule through mechanical washing of the lens epithelial cells (LEC) from the capsule bag with the fluid pulses. The reduction of LECs has been shown to help prevent PCO. The OSCA is a newly presented system of PCO computer assessment, evolved from previous systems. It is based on location-sensitive entropy based texture analysis of digital images. It was presented by Aslam in 2006. The OSCA results are compared to EPCO 2000 outcomes in this study. The EPCO 2000 is a computer-assisted system of PCO morphological assessment which incorporates planimetric and grading assessment. No correlation between OSCA and EPCO 2000 outcomes is expected.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The following will be measured at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years after surgery: \n1.

The possible range is from 0 (no PCO) to approximately 15 (practical expected maximum). Typical OSCA values for images with very little or no PCO is around 0.5.

It includes two age-related modules: a module for children aged four to eight years and a module for children aged more than or equal to eight years. The learning process for child and parents consists of five steps: Know, Dare, Can, Will, and Do. \n\nThis approach was derived from a multidisciplinary behavioural treatment developed in a tertiary hospital in Nijmegen in the Netherlands, to treat children with defaecation disorders. Basic assumption of this BT is that fearful and phobic reactions related to defaecation and faecal incontinence can be reduced and that adequate defaecation straining and toileting behaviour can be (re-)acquired by teaching parents behavioural procedures and by behavioural play therapy with the child. Pediatric psychologists in cooperation with co-therapists for children aged four to eight years and without co-therapists for children more than or equal to eight years, carried out BT. \n\nBT consisted of visits lasting approximately 45 minutes.

All diagnoses were based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), administered by a trained investigator. After the protocol explained to the patient and at least one first degree relative, both gave written informed consent for participation of the patient in the trial. Subject screening included medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, and laboratory screen including Liver Function Tests (LFTs), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine, and serum toxicology. All psychotropic medication (except benzodiazepines) was discontinued at least one day before randomisation.\n\nSubjects entering the study were randomly assigned to receive the Protein Kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, tamoxifen or identical placebo tablets in a 1:1 ratio and double-blind fashion for three weeks. Computer-generated codes were used to create randomisation kits (prepared by the ARGEFAR, a contract research organization). The starting dose of tamoxifen was 20 mg twice daily (bid). After the first treatment day, daily dose was adjusted upward by 10 mg per day up to 80 mg/d in divided doses. Similar tablet adjustments were applied for the patients in placebo group. Concomitant use of oral lorazepam (2.5 mg dissolving tables) was allowed during double-blind therapy as clinically indicated. \n\nIn cases where lorazepam is thought to be ineffective and the symptoms are such that an antipsychotic is required, risperidone liquid formulations (2-6 mg/day) were used under emergency circumstances. Those subjects who were given risperidone were assumed as drop out at the time of first exposure to risperidone; and new subjects for replacement of those cases have been recruited. Yet, the subjects who volunteer to continue study drug, assessed weekly without opening blind and data on combined use of open label risperidone and blind tamoxifen is presented in a separate section.

We have already developed a computer-based system for generating individually tailored feedback reports designed to encourage and help smokers to quit. These self-help materials tailored for each individual mimic the care used in clinical settings, but make this available to the general public. We plan to adapt this system for use in general practice, modifying the questionnaire and the feedback reports to different educational levels. The pilot work will lead to a large RCT evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention. The hypothesis to be tested on smokers identified from general practitioners lists is that: Personalised feedback reports tailored to levels of reading ability and sent to smokers in varying stages of readiness to quit, will increase quitting activity and modify the attitudes of the smokers over and above that found with usual standard care received from the practice.\n\nPlease note that this trial was completed on the 30th June 2005. The previous end date for this pilot study was 31/05/2009.

A modest success rate could have a large effect on public health given its recruitment potential and make a valuable contribution to lowering smoking prevalence. The method mimics the guidelines of asking, advising, assessing, assisting and arranging and could be incorporated into GPs standard treatment at less time and cost. These materials, tailored to the requirements of each individual, would offer GPs and practice nurses an efficient way of integrating smoking cessation counselling into a busy primary care practice.
