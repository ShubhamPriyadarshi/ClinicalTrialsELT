Either Itrel 3 or Synergy implantable generators were used. The spinal cord stimulation lead was chosen by the investigator from any Medtronic commercially available lead approved for use in refractory angina pectoris. The implant was performed according to the instructions in the technical manuals accompanying the devices. The lead was placed such that adequate/optimal paraesthesia was obtained in the area of angina pain. When adequate paraesthesia coverage was obtained the physician went on to permanent implant of the pulse generator. Proper patient education both pre and post implant of the device is essential. The investigator was responsible for adequately and regularly checking the integrity of the system at 3 months, 12 months and then annually. The stimulator should be used prophylactically by the patient for a minimum of 3 hours per day (for example: 3 times per day for a duration of 1 hour each). However, there is no upper limit and the patient may use the device as much as needed. Parameters for this stimulation vary from patient to patient. Therefore, the physician and patient need to work together to establish an effective and tolerable level. The stimulator should also be used at time of anginal attack to treat the pain. A higher level of stimulation may be used for this acute treatment. The maximum tolerable amplitude should be set for such use. However, it is necessary to assure that this level is not uncomfortable or painful. \n\nFor this trial any commercially available Percutaneous Myocardial Revascularisation could be used. An optical fibre is inserted via the femoral artery under local anaesthesia and passed up into the left ventricle. Energy from a Ho:YAG laser is applied to the endocardial surface of the myocardium to vaporise the myocardial tissue and create channels from the endocardial surface into the myocardium. The co-axial system allows the laser to be manipulated in 3 planes giving access to the whole of the left ventricle. The laser position is monitored by fluoroscopy in orthogonal views. Once the position of the laser has been checked in both views, the laser is fired. Two bursts of the laser are used to create a channel 4-6 mm deep, in the myocardium, except in the apex where only one burst is used. The position is marked in both views on acetate sheets attached to the fluoroscopy monitors. Laser channels are created at a minimum of 1 cm apart, and are placed to cover the target region.

Current UK recommendations advise the public to eat at least two portions of fish every week including one of oily fish, which is rich in omega-3 PUFAs, or take more than 200 mg/day of omega-3 PUFAs.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one portion should provide an equivalent of 200-500 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In fact most people in the UK consume considerably less than one portion per week indicating that the recommended levels are not being achieved leaving fish oil supplementation as the most convenient route to augment dietary intake.  However, reaching recommended intake levels may require taking several capsules of fish oil per day. An alternative is to use a more palatable version of liquid fish oils presented as a flavoured emulsion, which may offer a more flexible route to achieve the required level of intake.\n\nApproximately 95% of dietary lipids ingested from foods consist of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and lipid digestion is initiated by the action of lingual/gastric lipases which, together with the physical mixing action of the stomach, produces small partially emulsified droplets containing mainly TAGs but also free fatty acids (FFA) and diacylglycerols. Further emulsification together with the action of pancreatic lipase results in the production of 2-monoacylglycerols (sn2-MAG) and free fatty acids and these are incorporated into mixed micelles before passive diffusion into the enterocyte. Once inside the enterocyte the fatty acids with less than 12 carbon atoms pass directly into the hepatic portal vein. However, most dietary fatty acids have a chain length greater than 12 and these are re-synthesised into TAG and incorporated into the chylomicron (CM) family of lipoproteins which are secreted into the lymphatic system and transported to the thoracic lymphatic duct where they enter the circulation. The fatty acid composition of the core of the CM - TAG generally reflects the dietary fatty acid profile, particularly in the first four to six hours postprandial period. The CM-TAG are rapidly hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) releasing between 70 and 90% of the total TAG and leaving CM remnants which are removed from the plasma via low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. There have been conflicting observations that the use of emulsified forms of fish oils in some studies has led to improved digestion and absorption of EPA and DHA with other studies showing no differences in absorption.\n\nPreliminary research in our laboratory has indicated that both the rate and extent of absorption of the fatty acids EPA and DHA improve if the oil is pre-emulsified prior to ingestion. This cross over absorption study was designed to establish whether pre-emulsification of an oil mixture leads to improved absorption of fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, compared with the non-emulsified form of the oil mixture.\n\nThe hypothesis of this trial is that absorption of fatty acids occurs more rapidly and extensively in a pre-emulsified form than in the straight oil.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Plasma fatty acid concentrations.", "secondaryOutcome": "No secondary outcome measures", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Approval received by the local research ethics committee (Lechyd Morgannwg Health) on the 2nd October 2002."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN43202606", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "2002.112"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised cross-over study with oral ingestion of a fatty acid mixture in the form of an oil mixture or a water miscible oil emulsion.", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Other"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2003-02-14T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2003-02-28T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["United Kingdom", "Wales"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "2b6f1d0e-2985-46e1-9b80-bf8d7e9d0fed", "name": "Obsidian Research Limited", "address": null, "city": "Port Talbot", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SA12 7BZ"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Healthy volunteer"}, "inclusion": "1.

One hundred and ninety six Intensive Care Unit (ICU) subjects with normal renal function or mild renal impairment requiring mechanical ventilation were studied. A pre-defined dosing algorithm permitted initial titration of the opioid followed by the addition of propofol (0.5 mg/kg/h) if required. A REMI-based regimen was very effective in the provision of optimal sedation and analgesia. The mean % hours of optimal sedation was 88.3% in the REMI group. Similar results were observed when using FEN. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall between-subject variability in the duration of optimal sedation. However for those subjects who achieved a Sedation Agitation Scale (SAS) score of four, variability was significantly lower when using REMI. \n\nPropofol was not required in 65% of subjects. When propofol was administered there was a trend towards less use in remifentanil subjects. The dosing algorithm facilitated rapid extubation in both treatment groups. REMI provided comparable haemodynamic stability compared to FEN. The adverse event profile observed for REMI was similar to FEN and was not unexpected for ICU subjects receiving an opioid agonist. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of REMI was unaltered in subjects with renal impairment. Although the elimination half-life of remifentanil acid was doubled and the clearance was reduced by half in subjects with mild renal impairment, no evidence of prolonged opioid effects were seen. REMI is therefore considered to effective and well tolerated in ICU subjects.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Between-subject variability around the mean percentage of hours of optimal sedation (Sedation Agitation Scale [SAS] score of 4).", "secondaryOutcome": "Efficacy: \n1.
