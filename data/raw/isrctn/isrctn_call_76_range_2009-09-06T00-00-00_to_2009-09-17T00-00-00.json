The participant was encouraged to bring a carer or other to act as an advocate. The research worker's role as facilitator was to act as a neutral third party external to the team. By taking this role, he was in the best possible position to achieve the following aims:\n1. To ensure that different options for the menu are explored\n2. To help all parties reach consensus wherever possible, such that the participant is happy to carry the JCP and all those it designates to act in future are willing to carry out the designated action\n3. If consensus cannot be reached one of two options are chosen by the patient; either the differences are made clear but the JCP retains this title as other contents have been agreed jointly, or, the document is renamed a crisis card because of the lack of joint agreement\nDuring the meeting, the contents of the plan were written down by the research worker in the form of the first person and using the exact words agreed on.\n\nChecking the JCP content\nAfter the planning meeting the research worker produced the typed version of the JCP as an A4 sheet. He then either met with the participant to check the content, or sent him or her the JCP and consulted him or her about the content over the telephone. If the participant wanted changes to be made, the research worker consulted relevant CMHT members if he deemed that the change required the team's agreement first.\n\nDistribution\nOnce any further changes had been made, copies were sent by the research worker to all those whom the participant had designated on the menu. The participant was also sent a clear plastic wallet for the JCP.\n\nControl intervention\nThe Joint Crisis Plan represents a new form of information held on paper by a patient. It was decided that in order to receive the best available care under usual conditions, the control group should receive whatever information was currently available on paper. At the time this consisted of two types:\n1. A copy of the Care Plan done as part of the Care Programme Approach (CPA)\n2. Leaflets on local services, different types of mental illness and other aspects of care\nAs all participants should have been given a copy of their care plan if covered by the CPA, and as none of the participating teams routinely gave out the second type of information, it was decided to make the latter the control intervention. Prior to beginning recruitment, the investigator and research worker visited each CMHT base and hospital to which patients from the participating sectors were admitted to collect whatever information was available. Participants in the control group were given whatever was available relating to their CMHT and Trust, plus any other relevant information we had found at their site or elsewhere. The types of information distributed were as follows:\nHospital admission (what to expect, what to bring, rules)\nMental health resource centres (services available, opening hours)\nMedication\nMental Health Act information booklet for patients ('Out of the Maze')\nSocial Security information on welfare benefits\nAdvocacy services\nSocial Services and voluntary sector information on local services (drop in centres, vocational training etc.\nInformation on mental illnesses\nTrust policies, e.g. on confidentiality, patients' access to their own notes and making a complaint where available.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2004 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15240438 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "fcf8f9e5-6b14-400c-90b1-f57f795366f7", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2004-07-17T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15240438"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder5020-0", "Funder5020-1"], "contactId": "Contact5460_5020", "sponsorId": "Sponsor5121"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact5460_5020", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Claire", "surname": "Henderson", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Box P029\nCommunity Psychiatry\nHealth Services Research Department\nDavid Goldberg Building\nInstitute of Psychiatry\nDe Crespigny Park\nCamberwell", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SE5 8AF", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7848 0729"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "C.Henderson@iop.kcl.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor5121", "organisation": "King's College London (UK)", "website": null, "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Institute of Psychiatry\nDe Crespigny Park", "city": "London", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SE5 8AF", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7836 5454"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "G.Dale@iop.kcl.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.13097.3c", "rorId": "https://ror.org/0220mzb33"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder5020-0", "name": "Medical Research Council (MRC) (UK) training fellowship in health services research", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder5020-1", "name": "South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SlaM) (UK)", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-09-07T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "22", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2003-02-11T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "06813178"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation of domiciliary medication review by pharmacists in Norfolk & Suffolk", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "The HOMER trial", "studyHypothesis": "To determine whether domiciliary medication review leads to reductions in emergency hospital admissions and an improvement in quality of life compared to standard care among elderly subjects (80 years old and over).", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Total number of emergency hospital admissions by 6-months", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

IMN (40mg) is as effective as PGE2 gel (dinoprostone 2 mg) for cervical ripening prior to the induction of labour at term.\n2. IMN (40mg) is associated with a lower incidence of uterine\nhyperstimulation than PGE2 gel (dinoprostone 2mg) for cervical ripening prior to the induction of labour at term.\n3.

Abnormal FHR patterns were assessed by cardiotocography performed from 30 minutes prior to drug administration until one hour after, and then at 6, 15.5, 17 and 24 hours or continuously once uterine contractions ensued.
