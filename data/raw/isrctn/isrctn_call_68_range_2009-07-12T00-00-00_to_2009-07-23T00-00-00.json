The oligosaccharide attached to the FSH molecule terminates in a negatively charged residue, thereby forming a variety of isoforms that differ in their isoelectric points. The acidic isoforms were found to have a reduced bioactivity, as assessed by its potency for stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and by a longer half-life time in the circulation compared with the less acidic isoforms.\n\nIt has been suggested that different glycoforms may encode for different functions or have enhanced activity for a particular function. It was hypothesised that not only the quantity but also the quality of FSH, in terms of isoforms, plays an important role in the early follicular phase.\n\nIn a small pilot study performed to determine the predictive value of FSH isoforms for the outcome of IVF treatment, no statistical differences could be found in the isoform-composition between poor and good responders. They concluded that it is not likely that FSH isoforms predict treatment outcome after IVF. \n\nTo evaluate whether the FSH isoform composition affected the efficacy of a product, a meta-analysis was performed that compared a preparation expressing an acidic isoform profile (urinary-derived Metrodin-HP) with a preparation rich in less acidic isoforms (recombinant derived Gonal-f\u00ae). A total of five randomised clinical trials that specifically compared these two preparations was identified and included in the analysis. All parameters relating to the direct effect of FSH on the follicle differed significantly in favour of the product rich in less acidic isoforms, while data on pregnancy outcome did not reach significance. It is suggested that the FSH isoform profile of commercial gonadotrophin preparations is of clinical importance and should be taken into account when evaluating efficacy. However, FSH isoform composition has received little or no attention and is considered of negligible clicnical effect.\n\nThe polycystic ovarian disease model would be ideal to test the possible different effects of gonadotrophins with different isoforms on the quality of oocytes.\n\nPCOS patients were excluded from all phase III studies comparing urinary FSH with recombinant FSH. PCOS patients are also difficult patients to treat in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) because of the difficulty to achieve optimum stimulation and the high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A large percentage of PCOS patients has a high body mass index and this adds more difficulty to stimulation protocols. It was reported that the quality of oocytes in PCOS patients is inferior to the non PCOS patients, however, the pregnancy rate is the same because of the large number of oocytes retrieved in PCOS patients.\n\nIt would be interesting to find out if using purified FSH (Fostimon\u00ae) would have a different effect on oocyte quality as compared to recombinant FSH as the two products have different isoform structure.

The yoga and fitness instructor interventions are not specified, in order to represent normal practice, but are well documented to allow comparison later. \n\nTo ensure standardisation of physiotherapy interventions, training for those physiotherapists delivering the programmes will be held on three occasions, supporting documentation will be provided and follow up advice and information for deliverers will be supplied as necessary by email and telephone. The content of the interventions for both strands is described below. The attendance and participation of each study participant will be documented on a weekly basis. \n\nThe control groups in both strands will not receive any intervention for the 12 weeks and were told to continue with their normal routine. Once the control period is over participants will receive the treatment of their choice but the response to this will not be assessed as part of this trial. \n\nStrand A: \n\nIntervention 1: Physiotherapy led strength and aerobic training \nParticipants will attend an hour long circuit class once a week for 10 weeks. This will be a circuit style class consisting of \"sit to stand\" / squat, bridging, resisted shoulder flexion, walking / bike, resisted elbow flexion, lunges or resisted knee extension, hip extension, calf raises. All exercises will be completed at 50-80% of the participants' one-repetition-maximum and the load will be increased by 2-5% when twelve repetitions are easily achieved. The aim is for the participant to be failing on the last repetition. If the next available load is higher than 2-5% (such as going from 1 kg to 2 kg in resisted shoulder flexion) the participant can increase the repetitions so that they are still failing to achieve full range on motion on the last one. The primary aim is to achieve 'overload' of the muscle to achieve gains in strength. Participants will be educated about the overload principle and that delayed onset of muscle soreness is a normal phenomenon. After five weeks of attending the class, participants will be advised to complete a second hour of strengthening themselves at home. \n\nA second component of the class will be advice regarding aerobic exercise. In the first class, 10 minutes will be devoted to formally explaining aerobic exercise, Uhtoff's phenomenon (whereby increasing heat in people with MS can temporarily exacerbate symptoms) and the evidence supporting aerobic activity. Each participant will be given a target heart rate. This will be calculated using the Karvonen formula which is: Target Heart Rate = Resting Heart Rate + 65% (Maximum Heart Rate). \n\nThe participants will be advised in the initial assessment how to get their resting heart rate, by feeling their carotid pulse for 30 seconds first thing on waking. The first beat they feel will be zero. As a maximal exercise test will not be conducted, each participant's age predicted maximum heart rate will be used as the target heart rate (i.e. 220 - age). If they are unable to detect a pulse they will aim to exercise at a Rate of Perceived Exertion level of 11-14. \n\nParticipants will be initially asked to complete two sessions of independent aerobic activity per week for 20-30 minutes. From week 5, they will be asked complete this three times a week. Participants can choose the type activity that they did (i.e. swimming / walking / running / cycling). They will take their pulse every 10 minutes to ensure they are achieving the correct intensity. \n\nIntervention 2: Fitness instructor led group exercise \nWhere possible, the fitness instructors will all have attained a level 2 National Certificate in Exercise and Fitness (NCEF). They will be given a standardised pack in order to document the interventions. \n\nIntervention 3: Yoga classes \nYoga instructors will be accredited by the Yoga Federation of Ireland. They will be given a standardised pack in order to document the interventions. \n\nStrand B: \n\nIntervention 1: Group physiotherapy \nParticipants attended a weekly hour long class for 10 weeks. The circuit style class consisted of exercises that combined strength and balance. Participants will complete six different exercises at each class. The exercises were adapted from the falls prevention literature where similar programmes have been seen to improve, balance and reduce the number of falls in an elderly population. \n\nThe six exercises and possible progressions are described below. These are to be performed in sets of 12. When a participant is able to perform 12 repetitions of an exercise safely this can be progressed up to 3 sets of 12 repetitions. When a participant can perform 3 sets safely the exercise will be progressed so as to continuously challenge the participant. Not all participants will progress through all the exercises. The progression is dependent on the ability of the participant and their safety while performing the exercises. \n\n1. 'Sit to Stand', progressed by altering: \n1.1. Hand Positioning - Participants may initially need to use hands for support to rise from chair, then progressing to hands by side and then to hands across chest \n1.2. Seat Height - Participants may initially require a higher seat height which can be lowered to increase the intensity of the exercise \n1.3. Repetitions - To be performed in sets of 12 and number of sets to be increased to 3 as participant progresses \n1.4. Weights - Handheld weights may be given to participants who need further progression \n2. Squat, progressed by altering: \n2.1. Support - Participants may initially need bilateral support, this can be decreased to unilateral and then to no support as participants' ability increases \n2.2. Repetitions - To be performed in sets of 12 and number of sets to be increased to 3 as participant progresses \n2.3. Weights - May be given to participants who are able to perform 3 sets of 12 squats safely with no support \n3. Calf raises, progressed by altering: \n3.1. Support - Participants may initially need bilateral support, this can be decreased to unilateral support and then to independent calf raises as participant progresses \n3.2. Repetitions - To be performed in sets of 12, to be increased as participant progresses \n3.3. Other options - If participants are able they may perform single leg calf raises or if they can perform 3 sets of 12 independent calf raises weights can be added as further progression \n\nThe following three exercises are to be completed within parallel bars. \n4. Step ups, progressed by altering: \n4.1. Support - Participants may begin with bilateral support, and then decrease to unilateral support, then to no support \n4.2. Stepping - Initially participants may step onto step and back to starting position, then step onto step and over, and then onto step, over and backwards to starting position \n4.3. Step height - When participants are comfortable with all directions of stepping step height may be increased \n5. Side stepping, progressed by altering: \n5.1. Support - Participants may begin with bilateral support, and then decrease to unilateral support, then to no support \n5.2. Number of steps - Initially participants may only take one step in each direction. This can be increased as participants' ability increases \n\nIf a participant is unable to take a step to the side, weight shifting from side to side in standing may be performed and progressed to stepping when the participant is able. \n\n6. Tandem stepping/walking, progressed by altering: \n6.1. Support - Participants may begin bilateral support, and then decrease to unilateral support, then to no support \n6.2. Stepping - Participants may initially just place one foot in front of the other and hold this position. The number of steps can then be increased as the participant progresses. \n6.3. Crossover - Participants may become competent at tandem walking. This can then be progressed to one foot crossing over in front of the other. \n\nIntervention 2: One-on-one physiotherapy \nThese participants will receive individual treatment depending on the problem list and goals established by the chartered physiotherapist who was treating them. The content of the intervention will be recorded for each individual treatment session. The duration of the individual sessions will be the same as the group led physiotherapy. \n\nIntervention 3: Yoga \nParticipants will attend a weekly yoga class of approximately one hour's duration. All yoga instructors will be members of the Yoga Federation of Ireland and will keep a log of the content of each yoga class.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2009 Protocol article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19607666 protocol", "publicationStage": "Protocol", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "1811c515-29ba-48ba-853b-dc81a398e1a1", "@outputType": "protocolarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2009-07-16T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19607666"}, "description": "protocol", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder18568-0", "Funder18568-1"], "contactId": "Contact56559_18568", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55133"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56559_18568", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Susan", "surname": "Coote", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Physiotherapy\nUniversity of Limerick", "city": "Limerick", "country": "Ireland", "zip": "-", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+353 (0)61 234 278"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "susan.coote@ul.ie"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55133", "organisation": "University of Limerick (UK)", "website": "http://www.ul.ie", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Castletroy", "city": "Limerick", "country": "Ireland", "zip": "-", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.10049.3c", "rorId": "https://ror.org/00a0n9e72"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder18568-0", "name": "Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland (MS Ireland) (Ireland) - through Tesco (UK) 'Charity of the Year' funding", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder18568-1", "name": "Pobal (Ireland) - Dormant Accounts Flagship Fund", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-07-20T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "24", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2008-09-30T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "41082378"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "New therapeutic approach to Tourette Syndrome in children based on a study of the effectiveness and safety of magnesium and vitamin B6", "scientificTitle": "New therapeutic approach to Tourette Syndrome in children based on a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind phase IV study of the effectiveness and safety of magnesium and vitamin B6", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "With respect to placebo treatment, the combination of 0.5 mEq/Kg magnesium and 2 mg/Kg vitamin B6 reduces motor and phonic tics and incapacity in cases of exacerbated Tourette Syndrome (TS) among children aged 7 - 14 years, as measured on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The clinical diagnosis of TS will be confirmed, and the YGTSS score ascertained, so that the patient may be included in the study and any subsequent fall in the global score recorded (at t0 ,t1, t2, t3 and t4).", "secondaryOutcome": "Metabolic changes in baseline and post-treatment PET will be recorded.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Ethics approval received from the Andalusian Government Committee for Clinical Trials on the 11th December 2006."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN41082378", "eudraCTNumber": "2006-005779-16", "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "PI06/90242;

Many patients with RA may have previously received physiotherapy or hydrotherapy treatment. To reduce carry over effects, those having either physiotherapy or hydrotherapy, for any reason, in the previous 6 months will be excluded.\n\nPatients attending the Rheumatology out-patient department with rheumatoid arthritis will be provided with a patient information leaflet (providing information about the study) and invited to complete a short screening questionnaire. Patients will be asked to express their interest in participating in the study at the end of the screening questionnaire. Patients will be asked to return this completed form to the Selly Oak Hospital Physiotherapy Department in the stamped addressed envelope provided.\n\nPatients interested in participating will then be asked to attend for physiotherapy assessment. The physiotherapist will carry out a full physical assessment and apply inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients not interested in the study, or who do not meet criteria, will he offered physiotherapy in the usual way as judged appropriate by the assessing physiotherapist. Those who are uncertain will be given an opportunity to discuss the study and will then be included if they meet the criteria and wish to be involved.\n\nSuitable patients will be asked for informed consent in writing and given a signed copy for their records.\n\nStaff in the department of physiotherapy will make all initial assessments. However treatments in the study will be managed by one of two senior physiotherapists. These staff will make equal contributions to land exercises and hydrotherapy.\n\nInterventions\n\nThe interventions have been designed to compare the effects of water immersion with exercise with land exercise. In all cases, patients will be treated once a week for 6 successive weeks. Each session will last approximately 30 minutes. Patients will be given written instructions on appropriate home exercises on completion of the intervention. Advice will be individualised as necessary according to current best practice.\n\nPatients will be randomised to one of two interventions in equal proportions, as follows:\n\nA. Hydrotherapy:\nGroups of 3 or 4 patients will, attend for hydrotherapy. Each session will consist of initial warm-up (approximately 5 minutes; including stretching and immobilisation). Muscle strengthening and joint mobility exercises will follow. Specific exercises will be tailored according to individual needs but will incorporate buoyancy assisted and resisted exercises for upper and lower limbs. Exercises will be progressed as required and related to functional activities where possible. A cool down phase (including gentle mobilisation and stretching) will conclude the session.\n\nB. Land exercise:\nGroups of six patients will receive instruction on appropriate exercise on land. Sessions will consist of an initial warm up (approximately 5 minutes; including stretching and mobilisation). Muscle strengthening and joint mobility exercises will follow. Specific exercises will be tailored according to individual needs with a focus on functional aspects such as sit to stand exercises and reaching above head height. Exercises will be progressed as required. A cool down phase will conclude each session.\n\nOne of two experienced senior physiotherapists will supervise all treatment groups. This reduces the risk of biases associated with a particular therapist. Exercise sessions will be at the same time of day each week.\n\nOur hydrotherapy pool permits a maximum of only four patients to be treated safely at any one time. The choice of number therefore reflects safe and effective use of resources. Six patients will be treated in each land exercise group. We believe that group sizes are sufficiently similar to allow valid comparisons between treatment groups.\n\nWithdrawal - Other interventions\n\nAt all times patient safety will be paramount and patients may be withdrawn at any time by the treating physiotherapist or a physician involved in the patients care, as determined by their professional judgement. Patients will also have the option of withdrawing from the study at any time without the necessity for giving a reason.\n\nSince this is a pragmatic trial no restrictions will be placed on use of other modalities by patients except for surgery. Changes in concomitant therapies such as steroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will be permitted to reflect routine practice. A detailed inventory of all therapies will be kept at the outset and at study end. Changes across groups will be compared and, if appropriate, statistical adjustments made when comparing the effect of our interventions.\n\nRandomisation and Conduct\n\nPatients will be randomised to groups A or B using sealed envelopes indicating treatment allocation. Envelopes will be prepared before the study begins and ordered as determined by flipping a virtual coin and heads designated hydrotherapy, tails land exercise. Randomisation and treatment allocation will be done by a research assistant not involved in the conduct of the study and at a distance from the treatment area.\n\nTreatment groups will be convened when sufficient numbers have accrued to assemble at least one whole group. Patients will be permitted to book into pre-arranged treatment slots according to their allocation. Flexibility in booking times will he allowed to encourage participation.\n\nPatients will be asked to attend weekly. Missed appointments for any reason will be recorded and compared across groups. Those defaulting on 2 or more of their 6 visits will be regarded as non-responders for the primary outcome. Patients will also be encouraged to maintain loyalty with their patient partners and treating physiotherapist to control for group and therapist effects.\n\nNB: All assessments and treatments are within the scope of normal clinical practice.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2007 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17331241 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "3c11feaa-34de-48d5-bcd2-10d24a4699f6", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2007-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17331241"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder12690-0", "contactId": "Contact49970_12690", "sponsorId": "Sponsor48583"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact49970_12690", "title": "Dr", "forename": "P", "surname": "Jobanputra", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Rheumatology\nSelly Oak Hospital", "city": "Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B29 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)121 627 1627"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor48583", "organisation": "Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder12690-0", "name": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (UK)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-07-15T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "20", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2004-09-30T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "25835525"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "A randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of giving self-help information to people with symptoms of acute stress disorder following a traumatic injury.", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "The aims of the study are:\n1.
