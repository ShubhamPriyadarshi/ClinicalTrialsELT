Remifentanil hydrochloride is a potent selective \u00b5 opioid receptor agonist characterised by a rapid onset and highly predictable offset of action (context-sensitive half-time of 3 to 6 minutes). In contrast to other opioids it does not accumulate, even after prolonged infusion or high administrated doses and its clearance is unaffected by hepatic or renal dysfunctions. Although its pharmacokinetics properties could be advantageous for postoperative balanced anaesthesia, without compromising early patient extubation, its withdrawal requires a specific strategy for postoperative pain management. Thereby, remifentanil is still not regularly used in the ICU and particularly in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to compare remifentanil combined with propofol to conventional sufentanil-based anaesthesia (sufentanil stopped at the end of the surgery), during the postoperative period of an elective cardio-pulmonary bypass graft surgery with extra corporeal circulation.

All patients received intramuscular morphine chlorydrate (0.1 - 0.15 mg/kg) and scopolamine (0.25 mg) before surgery as premedication. \n\nStandard monitoring for cardiac surgery was used and included a CCO/SvO2 pulmonary artery catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) and a bispectral (BIS) monitoring (Aspect Medical Systems, USA) to control the depth of anaesthesia. \n\nA radial artery catheter was placed before induction of anaesthesia. Induction sequence was similar in both groups, with intravenous administration of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), sufentanil (0.5 mcg/kg) and rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg). Anaesthesia was maintained by Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) of propofol 2% (Asena PK\u00ae, Alaris medical systems, USA) adjusted to a plasma concentration of 1 - 2 mcg/ml, in order to maintain the BIS index between 45-60. Intraoperative analgesia was provided in the R group by a TCI (Asena PK\u00ae, Alaris medical systems) of remifentanil (50 mcg/ml) adjusted to a target plasma concentration of 4 ng/ml, and in S group, by continuous infusion of sufentanil (50 mcg/ml) started at 0,5 mcg/kg/h. During surgery the adaptation of doses, depending on the haemodynamic responses to surgical stress, was left to the discretion of the anaesthetist in charge of the patient. \n\nStandard institutional methods were used for normothermic (36\u00b0C) CBP and myocardial protection. At the end of surgery, the propofol infusion was maintained in both groups. The TCI of remifentanil was maintained at a target concentration of 4 ng/ml in the R group while the sufentanil was stopped in the S group. In order to blind the ICU team to the group assignment, the anaesthetist in charge of the patient prepared 40 ml syringes labelled \"substance X\" containing either remifentanil (50 mcg/ml) for R group or normal saline solution for S group. He also prepared another 20 ml syringe labelled \"substance Y\" for the postoperative relay of analgesia containing piritramide (0.20 mg/kg) for patients in R group, and normal saline for S group. These syringes accompanied the patient to the ICU. \nThe time of the patient's arrival to the ICU was defined as H0. From H0 to H4, all patients were maintained intubated and sedated by continuous administration of propofol 2% and TCI of \"substance X\" (remifentanil or NaCl 0.9% according to the allocated group). In both groups, the target concentration of substance X was set to 4 ng/ml, whereas propofol infusion was adapted to maintain the bispectral index between 60 and 70. During this period, patients were mechanically ventilated in a pressure-controlled mode (Servo-i Maquett Critical Care, Sweden) with a rate of 10 inflations/min and tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Arbitrarily, the positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 5 cmH2O and the inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) was adjusted to maintain pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95%. Minute-volume was adjusted to maintain an arterial pH between 7.35 and 7.45 and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) between 35 and 45 mmHg. \n\nThe weaning of anaesthesia was as follow: at H3, analgesic treatment including paracetamol (1 g), tramadol (100 mg) and \"substance Y\" (20 ml piritramide in R group or saline solution in S group) was slowly administered. \n\nAt H4, if all the criteria for weaning were present (temperature >36.5 \u00b0C, no sign of haemodynamic impairment, chest tube output <50 ml/h, adequate respiratory exchanges with arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) >=80 mmHg with FiO2 <40%, PaCO2 <=45 mmHg with pH >7.35, urine output >0.5 ml/kg/h), both propofol and \"substance X\" were stopped. \n\nPressure support ventilation was started immediately at patient's awakening. When all the weaning criteria were fulfilled (patient responding adequately to verbal commands, no major organ dysfunction), a T-piece trial was performed during a few minutes. During this period, pain evaluation was assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0: no pain to 100: worst imaginable pain. Pain relief was achieved with repeated intravenous administrations of piritramide (1 mg/1 mg), until VAS became less than 30 for all patients. Then, if the SpO2 could be maintained above 95% and if the respiratory rate was between 12 and 20/min, patients were extubated. \n\nFrom extubation to the discharge from the ICU, every patient received nasal oxygen guided by SpO2 and arterial blood gas measurements. Hypoxemia and/or respiratory acidosis was treated with non-invasive ventilation (VNI) and if necessary with invasive ventilation. \n\nAfter extubation, all patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of tramadol (400 mg) during 24 hours, associated with regular administration of paracetamol (1 g every 6 hours). Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with piritramide provided additional analgesia during 72 hours (concentration of 2 mg/ml, bolus of 1mg, minimal interval of 5 minutes and maximum cumulative dose of 25 mg/4 h). \n\nDuring the sedation period, hypotension (mean AP <65 mmHg) and/or inadequate cardiac output for tissue perfusion (CI <2.5 l/min/m2, SvO2 <65%, arterial lactates >1.5 mM/l, urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h) required a decrease in propofol if the BIS level was lower than 60 and fluid loading was administered if filling was inadequate (CVP <12 mmHg and PCWP <15 mmHg). If these measures were insufficient, atrial pacing was initiated at a rate of 90 to 100/min if the intrinsic rate was lower. Continuous intravenous administration of noradrenaline or dobutamine was initiated if hypotension persisted and if CI was respectively higher or lower than 2.5 l/min/m^2. \n\nHypertension (mean AP >80 mmHg) required an increase of propofol doses if the BIS level was higher than 70 and if necessary, was treated by afterload reduction with intravenous nicardipine chlorhydrate.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Remifentanil, sufentanil"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder17904-0", "contactId": "Contact55887_17904", "sponsorId": "Sponsor54451"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55887_17904", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Robin", "surname": "Lovat", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, 10", "city": "Bruxelles", "country": "Belgium", "zip": "1200", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor54451", "organisation": "Saint Luc University Clinic (Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc) (Belgium)", "website": "http://www.saintluc.be", "sponsorType": "Hospital/treatment centre", "contactDetails": {"address": "Avenue Hippocrate 10", "city": "Bruxelles", "country": "Belgium", "zip": "1200", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.48769.34", "rorId": "https://ror.org/03s4khd80"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder17904-0", "name": "Saint Luc University Clinic (Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc) (Belgium)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2008-08-05T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "16", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2008-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "64791295"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "A phase III, single-blind trial to assess efficacy and tolerability of genital mucosa after use of product INC056", "scientificTitle": "A phase III, single-blind, single-centre trial to assess efficacy and tolerability of genital mucosa after use of product INC056 in post-menopausal women", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "This study is to confirm the safety, tolerability and efficacy of INC056 in post-menopausal female volunteers.\n\nHypothesis:\nThis treatment is expected to lower the vaginal pH in post-menopausal women and thus, to relieve local irritability and dryness of vagina.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Evaluate vaginal acidification after product use (lowering of vaginal pH) at all visits (baseline and days 14, 30, 37 and 52).", "secondaryOutcome": "The following will be assessed at all visits (baseline and days 14, 30, 37 and 52):\n1.

In carrageenan induced inflammation model, 5-Loxin\u00ae confers a significant improvement in paw inflammation in albino Wister rats. Cell based in vitro studies and in vivo experiments conducted in Sprague Dawley rats demonstrate that 5-Loxin\u00ae potentially inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Tumour Necrotising Factor (TNF)-alpha and Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta (yet to be published). Furthermore, affimatrix gene chip analysis demonstrates 5-Loxin\u00ae can potentially inhibit the TNF-alpha induced gene expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), adhesion molecules such as Inter-Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and mediators of apoptosis in human micro vascular endothelial cells.

Small modifications in intake of energy-dense foods can prevent weight gain and induce modest weight loss. However, even when motivated to make small changes to the diet, it is often difficult to make and maintain these changes. This so-called intention-behaviour gap is likely to be reduced with Implementation Intentions (IIs).\n\nII\u0092s are specific action plans, defining where, and when to perform a particular action. With these action plans people are more likely to turn their intended behaviour into action. Effects of IIs have been found for relatively simple and singular behaviours. The present study will test the effects of implementation intentions for making changes in energy intake, a more complex behaviour. The II\u0092s are added to a computer-tailored advice delivered in web-based format.\n\nQuestions addressed in this study are: \n1. Can IIs contribute to making actual changes in energy intake?\n2.
