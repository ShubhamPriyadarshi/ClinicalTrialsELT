The objective of the study is to show that Silexan is effective and safe in treating mixed anxiety and depression, where the main symptoms are low mood, prominent anxiety, loss of interest with associated symptoms, restlessness and tension and disturbed sleep. \n\nWho can participate? \nAdult male and female patients (aged 18 \u0096 65 years) with symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nWhat does the study involve? \nOne group of the patients will receive Silexan for 10 weeks. The other group will take a placebo (dummy) instead. During the study the severity of the symptoms of the disease will be measured using established scales. The scales are either self-reported or will be assessed by a trained assessor.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThe participants who receive verum can expect an improvement of their symptoms of anxiety and depression. There are no know risks of using lavender oil active ingredients.\nWhere is the study run from? \nFrom about 30 medical centres in Germany. \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study will start in October 2012 and will run for about 15 months until the required number of 300 patients have been recruited and treated. \n\nWho is funding the study? \nDr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.

Prostate cancer in advanced stages develops metastasis- most often in bones. In the clinical course, the cancer is very often resistant to hormone therapy (androgen resistance), which is associated with a poor outcome. For 20 - 40% of patients, those with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis there is currently no effective treatment. Basis in the current diagnosis of prostate cancer are digital rectal examination (DRE), the determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and prostate biopsy. PSA is currently the most specific tumour marker for diagnosis, screening and monitoring of prostate cancer. PSA is not a disease-specific marker, since it is also increased in a condition called benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and in infected/inflamed prostate glands, conditions which are rather common (they can occur in 25-86% of prostate cancer patients). Also PSA levels may be raised in other non-cancerous diseases, and may even be raised in healthy individuals and there is also the possibility that prostate cancer may be missed in a significant number of patients. The limitations of the PSA assay reflect the lack of reliable measures for predicting the transition from local to metastatic cancer stages. New methods are needed to help doctors in their diagnosis.\nThe GILUPI GmbH developed a medical device for the isolation of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) directly from the bloodstream. This method has the advantage of capturing the limited number of CTCs directly, instead of using a small blood sample. A thin medical wire, also called nanodetector, is inserted through a conventional venous cannula routinely placed in a vein in the elbow area, so that about 2 cm of the wire reach into the bloodstream. The nanodetector has a special coating which has the ability to bind cancer cells, which after removal of the wire can be counted under the microscope, thus estimating the number of circulating tumour cells in the patient\u0092s blood. This in vivo method has the advantage of \u0093fishing\u0094 for tumour cells in a much larger volume instead of using only a small blood sample from the patient. Using the fishing analogy, a blood draw would resemble a person going to a river with a bucket and hoping to have a fish in a bucket full of water, whilst the nanodetector resembles a fishing rod placed into the river.\nWith this study we want to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the nanodetector regarding the isolation of EpCAM-positive tumour cells in prostate cancer patients compared to benign prostate disease and healthy individuals. Secondary objectives are to compare the nanodetector method with the reference system CellSearch, and to see if the isolated tumour cells can be used for the analysis of certain cancer related proteins.\n\nWho can participate?\nRequirements to participate in the study:\nGroup A: prostate cancer patients, confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer of any stage\nGroup B: BPH control group, Confirmed diagnosis of any stage of BPH\nGroup C: Healthy control subjects, female\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nIf you take part in the study, first of all, you will be asked to give a small sample of blood to test blood values for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Should you be eligible to participate, the nanodetector will be inserted in an elbow vein. The procedure of the insertion of the nanodetector is similar to inserting a small tube for blood collection and takes 30 min. This is a standard procedure in hospitals and medical practices. All patients in the study are treated in the same way. Afterwards you will be asked again to give a small sample of blood to check if blood values change after the insertion of the nanodetector, and to have a sample for the control method Cell Search.\nIf you are in group A with prostate cancer and with metastases, you will have 8 applications with the nanodetector (every month in for the first six months, 7th application in the 9th month, 8th application in the 12th month). If you are in group A with prostate cancer without metastases, you will have 3 applications (before surgery, 6 months after surgery and one year after operation). If you are in group B (BPH) you will have 3 applications (1st month, 6th month, 12th month). If you belong to group C (healthy subjects) you will have one application.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe cancer patients participating benefit from increased regular medical care, ranging from the provision of additional, non-routine measurement of certain blood parameters (cytokines, and the results of clinical examination (results of downstream diagnostics: ability to distinguish between a localized and metastatic prostate cancer).\nThe application with the nanodetector is similar to a normal blood collection. Therefore the risk for the participants is comparable to the risk of a normal blood collection. All insertions of the nanodetector will be carried out by trained physicians. \n\nWhere is the study taking place?\nThe study takes place at the university hospital and health care centre of Urology and Kidney transplantation centre of the Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany. \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nPatients have been enrolled since December 2010, and the study will end 1 year after inclusion of the last cancer or BPH patient. By that time 105 patients should have been enrolled. \n\nWho is funding the study?\nThe study is being funded by the GILUPI company (Potsdam, Germany)\n\nWho is the main contact?\nKathrin Haubold (Trial Manager)\nkathrin.haubold@gilupi.com", "primaryOutcome": "1.

During first postoperative week pain is intense. Commonly used ibuprofen and paracetamol-codein combination or tramadol hydrochloride are not sufficient for adequate pain treatment at home. New methods are needed. Topical anaesthesia with ropivacaine is a safe, simple and easy method to prevent pain but we do not know well enough whether this method works. \nThe aim of this study is to test how well topical ropivacaine works on prevention of postoperative pain in adult patients for two postoperative weeks.\n\nWho can participate? \n160 adult patients scheduled for elective day-surgery tonsillectomy will be recruited. \nWe will be recruiting patients for approximately 6-8months to reach the goal of 160 patients. We will try to recruit 8 patients per week.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nAfter tonsillectomy has been performed under general anaesthesia, each tonsillar fossae will be tightly packed with two swabs containing either 80mg ropivacaine or saline. After five minutes, swabs will be removed and after that general anaesthesia terminated and patient extubated. Other than that, patients will receive standard care. Pain will be evaluated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for two hours. After discharge, patients will receive daily for two weeks an email containing a link to a questionnaire in a database. Patients will be asked to answer questions on pain and other symptoms, as well as the amount of pain medication used.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere is no additional risk to patients compared to the normal clinical procedure, in which local infiltration anaesthesia is sometimes used to prevent postoperative pain. When local anaesthesia is used after tonsillectomy, there is a possibility that patients might have trouble in swallowing, so this will be monitored closely after the operation. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe study will be run in the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Eye-Ear Clinic, by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and the Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.

Although the risk of spreading to other organs and loss of life is relatively low compared to melanoma skin cancer, lesions of NMSC need to be removed as they will otherwise keep on growing unchecked. Early treatment prevents avoidable deaths and complications and treatment of less progressed lesions usually is less burdensome to the patient and can avoid repeated treatments. \nThe problem which limits the number of lesions treated at an early stage is that the condition does not have any symptoms. That is, early lesions do not itch, present little or no scaling or redness and are difficult to notice. As a result, many lesions of NMSC go unnoticed by the patient or GP.\nThere is a new method for identifying NMSC called fluorescence detection. Fluorescence is phenomenon that some compounds emit light (i.e. glow) when they are illuminated with a certain kind of light. Some compounds are either more or less prominent in NMSC fluoresce, which can be used to identify NMSC, i.e. detect them based on their fluorescence properties. \nIn this study we us a compound called 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) which is applied to the skin and after the application, one can find the NMSC by looking for those areas of the skin that show relatively high levels of fluorescence.  This should allow a specialist to be able to find NMSC before they are visible to the naked eye. This study aims to find out if fluorescence detection is more accurate than the traditional clinical inspection at finding NMSC. \n\nWho can participate? \nAny person being suspected of having a NMSC with Fitzpatrick skin type I, II or III.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nParticipants have a standardized clinical inspection. A trained doctor examines the skin in a systematic manner in order to find symptoms associated with NMSC. During the examination the doctor looks at your skin to see if there are any reddish lesions, or if there is some scaling. In addition, the doctor feels if there are some irregularities such as scaling or bumps. Every time the doctor finds an area that might contain a NMSC, it is noted on a form for later investigation. Following the inspection, fluorescence detection is performed. This consists of the application of a spray containing 0.5% 5-aminolevulinic acid for 2.5 hours, following which fluorescence  measurements are performed with a specially developed camera and system. Those areas which based on the fluorescence detection or the clinical inspection are deemed to be suspicious of containing a NMSC are further investigated, identified and if necessary treated. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nBenefits of the study include identifying NMSC earlier so that patients can be treated earlier. There is a risk of some minor irritation of the skin (some red spots and some swelling) if it is exposed to intense sunlight after the investigation, which can last for three hours. The spray used in this study contains fats. As a result, skin will be a bit greasy. Participants will need to have a shower or take a bath before going to bed, otherwise some minor skin irritation can occur. If the skin gets irritated then there is no need for concern. The symptoms will disappear within a week without further treatment. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nZBC Multicare, the Netherlands\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in late 2011 and ended in early 2012. \n\nWho is funding the project?\nZBC Multicare\n\nWho is the main contact? \nNick van der Beek\nnick.vanderbeek@zbcmulticare.nl", "primaryOutcome": "1.

Although rarely fatal, MS produces a range of unpleasant and disabling symptoms. The course of MS is idiosyncratic and unpredictable and although the majority of patients experience a relapsing-remitting form of the illness, ultimately most patients experience a transition towards persistent disability. The nature and presentation of MS poses multiple psychosocial challenges. Individuals are faced with uncertainty about the future, unpleasant and unpredictable symptoms, treatment regimes and drug side effects. Since MS can have profound consequences including disruptions to life goals, employment, income, relationships, social and leisure activities and daily activities, it is unsurprising that it poses challenges for psychological adjustment. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention based upon the principals of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to assist people in the early stages of MS to adjust to living with the disease. \n\nThe study aims to: \n1. Develop a CBT manualised programme for adjusting to MS that can be delivered by general nurses receiving basic training in CBT and regular supervision \n2. Determine whether patients with early stage MS who undertake a CBT course for adjustment to MS will demonstrate significantly greater reductions in key adjustment outcomes (less distress, and improvements in work and social adjustment) than those assigned to a Supportive Listening comparison condition\n3. Examine the changes in beliefs, cognitions and behaviours in the two treatment groups and determine whether changes in these variables mediate improvements in distress and work and social adjustment\n4.

This assessment will include a detailed standardized physical examination and collection of baseline data. The tests that will be used are the posterior pelvic pain provocation test, the active straight leg test, Patrick's or FABERE test, a modified Trendelenburg's test, Lasegue test and palpation of the symphysis pubis.\n\nThe study will comprise a one-week baseline period, eight weeks of treatment and follow up of the independent examiner within one week after the last treatment. All participants will get standard treatment as well as acupuncture. Standard treatment consists of general information about the condition and anatomy of the back and pelvis. Adequate advice and practice are given with respect to patient activities of daily living. The physiotherapist makes sure that the patient understands and respects the relationship between impairment, load demand, actual loading capacity, and importance of necessary rest. The purpose of this information is to reduce fear and to enable patients to become active in their own treatment. The patients will get a pelvic belt (Puff Ig\u00e5ng AB, Sweden) and home programme exercises designed to increase strength in the abdominal and gluteal muscles.\n\nThe patients will be randomised to one of two interventions:\nGroup 1 will get standard treatment plus 12 acupuncture treatments with penetrating needles for eight weeks\nGroup 2 will get 12 acupuncture treatments with non-penetrating needles for eight weeks\n\nLocal acupuncture points will be selected individually after diagnostic palpation to identify sensitive spots. A total of 10 segmental points and 7 extra-segmental points will be used. The penetrating needles (Hegu: Hegu AB, Landsbro, Sweden) or the non-penetrating needles (Asiamed GmbH & Co., Konrad Streitberger is the developer) are made of stainless steel (\u00d80.30). The penetrating needle is inserted intramuscularly to a depth of 15-70 mm to evoke needle sensation, described as tension, numbness and often a radiating sensation from the point of insertion, reflecting activation of muscle-nerve afferents.

An important but neglected part of quality of life is fatigue, during but also after treatment for cancer. Three recent studies in our institute have shown that 20 - 40% of disease-free cancer patients mention invalidating fatigue as a frequent complaint one to six years after curative treatment for cancer has ended. No relations were found between fatigue long after treatment for cancer and initial disease- and treatment variables. Somatic treatment for these complaints of fatigue is lacking. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is a promising treatment to reduce fatigue and related functional impairment in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\n\nThe purpose is to evaluate whether Cognitive Behaviour Therapy is effective in reducing chronic fatigue complaints in disease-free cancer patients, in a randomised-controlled study.\n\nHypotheses:\n1. What is the effect of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in severely fatigued disease-free cancer patients on fatigue, functional impairment and psychological well being compared to patients waiting for this treatment?\n2.

A total score of psychological well-being can be obtained as well.", "secondaryOutcome": "Besides the questionnaires used to measure the major outcome variables, additional questionnaires will be used to measure:\n1. Depression, anxiety and sleep: the SOL will be used to measure these variables, patients register their quality of sleep every day during a two-week period\n2.

Physical activity: this will be measured with the actometer, an apparatus developed by our department of Medical Psychology. It records the number of movements in every five minute period. It is worn around the ankle day and night for a consecutive two-weeks\n4. Quality of life: The EORTC consists of five functional scales (physical-, role-, cognitive-, emotional-, and social functioning), nine symptom scales and one scale for global health status.

This manual will be developed with the clinical staff involved in order to represent current practice and optimise compliance. Treatment will be applied with the patient positioned according to an agreed protocol for optimal drainage of secretions.
