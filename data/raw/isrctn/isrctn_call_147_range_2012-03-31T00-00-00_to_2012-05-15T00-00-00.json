However, they have not become the standard of care in any country. Despite recommendations from health professionals and politicians, and despite specific legislation in the USA in 1993, ADs remain infrequent (about 1 to 2 in 10). They are often not at hand when needed, are vague so that they prove no help for the concrete treatment decisions to be made, are questionable with regard to their validity (i.e. it is not sure whether the text of the AD is identical to what the person had in mind when drawing up the AD, let alone whether the person is still of the same opinion), and they are not being followed by health professionals for various reasons. Therefore, many researchers have drawn the conclusion that the instrument \u0093AD\u0094 itself is flawed and should therefore as such be abandoned.\nAdvance care planning (ACP), on the other hand, is a novel approach to enable people to make their personal end-of-life decisions. The idea behind ACP is that end-of-life decision making for future scenarios needs a complex response. Signing a form that contains standard sentences, which is often the case with traditional ADs, is not likely to have such a complex response. \nACP, in contrast, rests on two pillars: \n1.\tRecognising that advance decision making for future hypothetical health crises can only be done on the basis a health professional\u0092s opinion, and that this opinion would need to be repeatedly offered over the time, to consider changes in health, chronic disease, and personal views towards life. \n2.\tRecognising that all health professionals concerned with patients who did ACP need to be involved in a regional effort to ensure that advance care plans are understood and valued.\nACP  is a regional initiative to establish structures that allow skilfully facilitated conversations for all members of a population group, and that warrant that the ACPs  resulting from such conversations will be honoured.\nIn February 2009, we started an ACP program in the nursing homes of one town, comparing the outcomes with a number of nursing homes of two other towns where no intervention was offered. The aim of that study was to train selected social workers in the nursing homes to facilitate ACP discussions with all residents, to train the family physicians to cooperate with the newly trained facilitators, and to contribute to supporting the residents making ACP.  With this follow-up study, we want to measure the long-term effect of our earlier study. \n\nWho can participate?\nThe study is carried out with two groups of residents of either sex, regardless of age. The first group is a random sample of all residents who live in the participating nursing homes at the time of data collection. The second group is a random sample of residents deceased in the second half of 2010. Residents who moved into the nursing homes less than 3 months earlier are excluded from the study.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nThe study only involves  measuring the long-term effect of the main study described above. In the intervention region, social workers employed in the residential homes were trained to facilitate ADP conversations with all residents. In the control region, there was no intervention. We expect that many, if not all residents in the intervention region\u0092s nursing homes will receive the opportunity to draw up meaningful AD on the basis of skilfully facilitated, comprehensive conversations. This is not standard in German nursing homes yet.\nWhat we want to find out is whether the residents living in the former intervention region are more likely to have AD in place that are relevant and valid than those living in the intervention region. We ask each residential home staff to look into their residents\u0092 charts and to document whether it contains an AD or not, and if yes to answer certain questions in order to describe the quality of this AD.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nSince this is a follow-up, there are no possible benefits or risks involved.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nThe coordinating centre is the department of General Practice at the University Hospital of D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). Three nursing homes of the original intervention region are compared with eight nursing homes in the original control region (both regions close to D\u00fcsseldorf).\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nData collection started in April and lasted until May 2011. Data were electronically processed and recently sent to the statistician in December 2011.\n\nWho is funding the study? \nGerman Ministry of Education and Research who also funded the original intervention study. \n\nWho is the main contact?\nDr. J\u00fcrgen in der Schmitten\njids@med.uni-duesseldorf.de", "primaryOutcome": "Availability of advance directives (in the resident's charts) that are:\n1.

Chemotherapy is used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. Nevertheless, most tumours inevitably progress and the clinical response rates to subsequent chemotherapy agents are disappointing. There is, therefore, a need for continued clinical research into new strategies to enhance the effectiveness of currently available chemotherapy agents to improve survival.\n\nThe endothelin pathway has been implicated in a number of oncogenic pathways. ET-1 and ETAR are frequently over-expressed in breast cancers and are prognostic for poor outcome. Inhibition of the endothelin pathway enhances cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapy agents such as carboplatin in pre-clinical models. ZD4054 is a specific inhibitor of ETAR and represents a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nThis study investigates whether ZD4054, an oral endothelin A receptor (ETAR) inhibitor, in combination with carboplatin chemotherapy, has sufficient activity to warrant a future Phase III trial in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Progression Free Survival (PFS) (time to event) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1). \nTime from enrolment to any progression and/or death.

A minimisation technique, where two stratification factors will be taken into account: site and severity of sepsis. Selected randomisation procedure guarantees that treatment arm cannot be predicted by the investigator. \n\nProducts: \nThe study product and comparator will be commercial products: \nControl product: Isocaloric and isonitrogenous standard enteral diet. Commercial product: Ensure Plus HN in 500 mL RTH container (Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories, Spain)\nStudy product: A low-carbohydrate, calorically dense liquid food (containing EPA, GLA and antioxidants)\nCommercial product: Oxepa (Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories, Spain) manufactured in Zwolle, The Netherlands for global distribution. Recommended rate for Oxepa is to begin full strength feeding at 20 - 30 ml/hr and increase by 10 ml every 8 hours until the goal rate is reached.\n\nDoses:\nTo calculate the total caloric daily intake to be given by EN, caloric needs were set 25 kcal/kg/day and protein intake of 1.5 g/kg/day, adjusting by ideal body weight for obese patients. Minimal required intake (at least 70% of the calculated dose) must be administered within 96 hours since the patient enters the study.\n\nAdministration:\nEnteral nutrition will be administered continuously with an infusion pump during 24 hours, through nasoenteral (gastric or pyloric) or transpiloric gavage. For its maintenance and efficacy, recommendations of the Nutritional and Metabolic Working Group of the Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Coronary Units, published in the journals Medicina Intensiva and Nutrici\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, will be followed. These procedures have already been tested in two large epidemiological trials, the COMGINE trial and the ICOMEP, the second one not published yet. Both trials confirm homogeneity in EN procedures between the ICUs that will take part in the study. \n\nTreatment duration:\nThe duration of treatment will be at least 5 days, counting from the time of randomisation until the end of the septic condition. The septic episode will be considered over when the patient does not meet the criteria for sepsis for 72 consecutive hours. No changes in regimen are considered during the study, except in cases of complications. All concomitant treatments (co-interventions) should be reflected in an easily legible manner for eventual review by the study monitor.\n\nTransfusion policy: \nTransfusion treatment is considered to be unrestricted and will be dealt with simply as another covariable (conventional versus restrictive transfusion). To this effect, the haemoglobin concentration prior to each transfusion will be recorded in the CRF.\n\nThe rest of supportive treatments usually used in daily care - including antibiotic or antifungal therapy and the different mechanical ventilation protocols - can be freely used according to criterion in each centre, though also in this case the CRF should document some variables of interest according to the prior experience of the group. The rest of supportive treatments are usually used in daily care, including antibiotics and vasoactive drugs, and the different mechanical ventilation protocols used followed the Survival Sepsis Campaign guidelines.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Phase IV", "drugNames": "Gamma linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, antioxidants"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2006 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16850002 results\n2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474219 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": [{"@id": "5151135f-c3bc-4026-898a-3afd3d4b997a", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2006-09-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16850002"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "da41df73-228b-45cd-9215-5268e38e3b91", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21474219"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}]}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder19228-0", "Funder19228-1"], "contactId": "Contact57228_19228", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55821"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact57228_19228", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Vicente", "surname": "Moran", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Intensive Care Department\nHospital de Le\u00f3n\nAltos de Nava, s/n.", "city": "Leon", "country": "Spain", "zip": "24071", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+34 98 72 37 400"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "vmoran@hleo.sacyl.es"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55821", "organisation": "Spanish Society of Intensive Care (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Medicina Intensiva) (Spain)", "website": "http://www.semicyuc.org", "sponsorType": "Research organisation", "contactDetails": {"address": "Critica y Unidades Coronarias\nPso.

The disease has been usually treated by whole-lung lavage under general anaesthesia or by repeated segmental lung lavage, which are stressful and painful for patients. In 1999 we discovered that the lungs and blood of patients with A-PAP contain large amounts of neutralizing autoantibody to granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Now it is thought that A-PAP is attributable to a reduction in the surfactant-degrading capability of alveolar macrophages as a result of the antibody. In recent years, Seymour et al. in Australia tried consecutive-day subcutaneous GM-CSF injection therapy, and reported that it improved the respiratory function of 44% of all severe cases of this disease without the need for pulmonary lavage. In 2001, we began using GM-CSF inhalation therapy to treat 3 cases of A-PAP (12 cycles of 7-day inhalation at intervals of 7 days, 250 \u00b5g/day) and found that it dramatically improved respiratory function and resulted in the disappearance of the autoantibody from alveolar lavage fluid. This study will be undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GM-CSF inhalation therapy in 30-40 patients with A-PAP.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Efficacy evaluation: \nThe primary end point will be an improvement in oxygenation as assessed by a >= 10 mm Hg decrease in the room air alveolar arterial oxygen gradient (A-aDO2). The therapy will be rated as effective in cases in which there is a >= 10 mmHg improvement in this parameter during the same period. The number of effective cases will be divided by the number of evaluation-capable cases among the total number of cases in the treatment group and that satisfy the inclusion criteria to obtain the response rate. The significance of the differences between A-aDO2 at the start and end of the untreated observation period and between the start and end of the induction treatment period will be tested by the paired t-test. \n\n2. Safety evaluation: \nDuring the therapy and follow-up visits, patients will be examined by a physician for signs of any drug-related toxicity, including the following points: \n2.1. Progression of the respiratory failure, assessed every four weeks from week 4 until week 24 (6-month visit) after initiation of therapy, and then 9, 12 and 18 months\n2.2. Allergic or anaphylactic reaction with the inhalation of GMCSF, assessed every four weeks from week 4 until week 24 (6-month visit) after initiation of therapy, and then 9, 12 and 18 months\n2.3.

Written consent will be confirmed just before their operation when they see the surgeon who will be doing their operation.\n\nAfter entry to the study, stockings of each type will be randomised using computer generated numbers on a 1:1 basis so that 30 patients will receive anti-embolism stockings and 30 will receive the new style. Patients will be asked to complete a visual analogue scale that measures the discomfort they feel in their legs. Patients will be asked to complete a similar scale for subjective measurement of bruising to their leg. Further information will be collected about stocking slippage and the use of the stockings. Patients will be asked to return to the day case unit two weeks after surgery for a post operative check and for collection of their data sheets and comments. This visit is in addition to their normal appointment at 6 weeks.\n\nStatistical analysis\nCategorical data such as slippage will be assessed using the Chi-square test. Variable data such as bruising and pain will be assessed using the Mann Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Sample Size calculation From personal data it is expected that 55% of patients who wear the anti-embolism stocking will experience slippage during their postoperative recovery. Data from Scholl who supply the new style of stocking suggest that a maximum of 20% of patients will experience slippage with their product. For an alpha error of 0.05 and Beta error of 0.2, 50 patients would need to be recruited. There may be a 20% non-compliance rate with follow up so a sample size of 60 has been set. Some 140 people have day case varicose vein surgery each year so recruitment should be complete relatively quickly. Involvement of Non-medical, non-hospital staff.

This study will be done in women's and children's hospital, HRI. During one year period there would usually be at least 300 epidural top ups for emergency LSCS in our labour suite. We decided to have a sample size of 50 patients in each group and calculated the power analysis from previous studies with alpha and beta of 0.05 and 0.2 respectively, looking for a 20% difference in the supplementation (either extra supplement of study drug or conversion to general anaesthetics) as highly significant. All patients having an epidural sited for pain relief in labour, once pain free, will be approached, and be asked to give informed consent. Using sealed envelopes, computer generated numbers will direct the anaesthetists as to which solution to use should an emergency LSCS become necessary. Usual documentation will be supplemented with the study data sheet and the anaesthetists responsible for the case will be asked to record all the relevant data.  These sheets will be marked with the patients unit number and trial number so that follow up is possible.  The data will be stored on a computerised database according to trial number alone. for any individual patient the study will end on completion of the study questionnaire during the routine anaesthetic follow up at 24 - 28 hours post LSCS. Consent will be obtained from women who are pain free after having received an epidural for pain relief during labour. Should such a patient require an emergency LSCS, the anaesthetist will time themselves preparing the randomly allocated solution. A stop watch situated in a trolley will allow for accurate time measurements and cause of any delays eg locating keys/ODA etc will be noted.  details of the woman's previous top ups will be recorded, as well as the anaesthetic/analgesic levels and the degree of motor block immediately prior to top up for LSCS.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Levobupivacaine, lidocaine/epinephrine/fentanyl"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2006 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16488138 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "91343b10-7e9f-4f99-b267-275314ae6374", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2006-04-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16488138"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder17008-0", "contactId": "Contact54969_17008", "sponsorId": "Sponsor53534"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact54969_17008", "title": "Dr", "forename": "P", "surname": "Balaji", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Hull Royal Infirmary\nAnlaby Road", "city": "Hull", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "HU3 2JZ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor53534", "organisation": "Record Provided by the NHSTCT Register - 2007 Update - Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "The Department of Health, Richmond House, 79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder17008-0", "name": "The North and South Bank Research and Development Consortium (UK), NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "22", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2007-09-28T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "34344346"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Supine versus Prone Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy for Proximal Ureteric Stones", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "We are looking at the effect patient position has on the success of lithotripsy for stones located in the upper ureter.

Women allocated to consultant-led care will receive public care where all pregnancy, birth and immediate postnatal care is provided by a team of midwives and obstetricians. However, it is recognised that some women, having been randomised to consultant-led care will opt for private care whereby a consultant obstetrician sees the woman at each antenatal visit and who may be present for the birth. \n\nImmediate postnatal care is provided by a team of midwives and the consultant obstetrician will usually visit the mother daily for the duration of her postnatal hospital stay. Within either option, antenatal care may be shared between the General Practitioner (GP) and the maternity hospitals within an agreed programme of care, which includes two postnatal visits to the general practitioner. \n\nMidwifery-led care (intervention group):\nFor the purpose of this study, midwifery-led care refers to care where midwives are, in partnership with the woman, the lead professional with responsibility for assessment of her needs, planning her care with her, referral to other health professionals as appropriate, and for ensuring provision of maternity services. Midwifery-led care will be provided for healthy women without risk factors for pregnancy and labour.\n\nAntenatal care for women randomised to midwifery-led care will primarily be provided by the midwife and shared with the GP who will be the primary source of referral to the Midwifery-Led Units (MLUs) and will, in most instances, have provided the first antenatal visit prior to booking at the MLU. Antenatal care will be provided by midwives in the MLUs and by GPs in GP surgeries. Where complications arise, the woman will be transferred to consultant-led care based on agreed transfer criteria (see 'Midwifery-led Unit (Integrated) Guidelines for Practitioners'). Women transferred to consultant-led care may, dependent on obstetric assessment, be transferred back to midwifery-led care as appropriate during the antenatal and postnatal periods (see 'Midwifery-led Unit (Integrated) Guidelines for Practitioners' for full details of reciprocal transfer arrangements). Women who require transfer to consultant-led care and are unsuitable for transfer back to midwifery-led care will be cared for as per current consultant-led care pathway (see consultant-led care above).\n\nIntrapartum care will be provided by midwives in a MLU, with transfer to consultant-led care from midwifery-led care as appropriate based on agreed transfer criteria. Full details of the services provided by the MLU are detailed in the MLU Booklet titled 'Midwifery-Led Services in the North Eastern Health Board'. To reduce potential psychological impact of an intranatal transfer to consultant-led care, the midwife caring for the woman in the MLU will, wherever possible, accompany and care for the woman during labour in the consultant-led unit.\n\nPostnatal care will be provided by MLU midwives in the MLU up to 48 hours after birth. On discharge from hospital, women will be cared for by a midwife from the MLU who will visit the woman in her home up to and including the seventh day post birth. The frequency of visits after discharge will be determined by the woman and the midwife based on the woman's individual needs. Thereafter care will be transferred to the Public Health Nursing service.

One of the biggest problems with the interpretation of these studies in the past has been the heterogeneity (mixed disease states) of the patients recruited and the variation in their requirements for pacing. The study will recruit only patients with similar clinical outlook or disease state to ensure a homogenous population that requires similar constant ventricular pacing. This unique cohort will be recruited following the removal of defective natural pacemaker (A-V nodal ablation) during the treatment for persistent irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation/flutter). A single chamber rate-responsive pacemaker will be implanted with leads in the RVA or RVOT position. The RVA will be defined as the most inferior and lateral l position providing acceptable pacing parameters in the right anterior oblique view. The RVOT will be defined as a position below the pulmonary valve and above a line drawn parallel to the RV inferior border, extending from the apex of the tricuspid valve (His) to the border of the right ventricle in an antero-posterion view, with acceptable pacing parameters. Patients ill then be allocated to one of the two types of pacemaker site settings by the toss of a coin (randomised) using a computer programme. 50% of patients will be chosen to undergo RVA pacing and the other 50% will undergo RVOT pacing. The pacemaker will be programmed according to standard clinical practice on an individualised patient basis. All other aspects of the procedure and subsequent care will be as per our routine practice for pacemaker implantation. All participants in this study will undergo transthoracic echocardiography (heart ultrasound scan) and exercise test before implantation, at 6, 12 and 24 months after the procedure to evaluate how the pacemaker is affecting their heart function and general physical fitness. A total of 80 patients will be recruited and the investigator will be responsible for screening all patients listed for AV nodal ablation on clinical grounds. The patients selected for participation will be part of the investigators general patient population meeting the indications for the use of a permanent pacemaker system. The patients will be randomised and included in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria and give informed written consent. The initial screening will consist of a single transthoracic echocardiogram, a simple exercise test with non-invasive measurement of cardiac output and Quality of Life questionnaires. The echocardiogram will be performed in standard views by an experienced member of staff with full Accreditation from the British society of Echocardiography. The exercise test will be performed on a cycle ergometer using a standard ramp protocol with second by second measurement of respiratory gases. Blood pressure will be measured at standard intervals using a calibrated sphygmomanometer and a 12-lead electrocardiogram monitored throughout.  Cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart at each cycle) will be measured at rest and during peak exercise using validated rebreathing methods described in the literature. The Cardiothoracic Centre is a stand-alone tertiary cardiac centre providing high quality electrophysiological services to the 2.8 million population of Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wales and the Isle of Man.

However, components such as sauces used to prepare ethnic meals at home also have a high salt content.\n\nA previous study for Salt Awareness Day 2005 stowed in individuals with high blood pressure that, in spite of claiming that they reduced salt intake by half, the 24 hour urine analysis of salt was still high - around 10g/day, illustrating that the public are very confused about where salt is in the diet and how sodium relates to salt. The same study showed that most people (69%) find nutrition labels incomprehensible.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to see whether education and advice for people of African-Caribbean descent in the form of a one-to-one training session addressing how to read a label and general education about how sodium relates to salt will result in a reduction in salt intake (as assessed by 24 hour urine collection).

There is preliminary evidence that psycho-dynamic-interpersonal therapy (PIT) is beneficial as it reduces the intensity of physical symptoms and increases quality of life. The trial interventions so far lacked generalizability over a larger clinical spectrum of disabling somatoform symptoms. We developed a multi-centre two-arm randomized controlled trial with a primary end point and follow-up after one year. PISO has two new aspects:\n1. PISO uses a diagnostic category that is independent of the type of currently dominant symptom and therefore serves as a common point of reference\n2. PISO uses a manualized psychotherapeutic intervention that is adapted to the specific lead symptom in the beginning, but later on emphasizes more general aspects of experiencing 'unexplained' physical symptoms across single functional syndromes and somatic specialities\nIn the trial, we test a bio-psycho-social model of change including psychobiological parameters like heart rate variability and prefrontal/limbic neural activations. If the intervention tested in PISO proves to be efficacious as compared to enhanced medical care it will be useful as an economic and versatile tool that is applicable in cooperation with psychosomatic medicine across a range of somatic specialities.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS): In patients with multi-somatoform disorder, symptom-related incapacity is best captured with the PCS.

PHQ-D: The 'Patient Health Questionnaire', German version (PHQ-D) is a brief self-report measure for anxiety, depression and other mental disorders. Criterion validity was established with respect to diagnostic gold standards and the PHQ has proven to be a responsive and reliable measure of depression treatment outcome (L\u00f6we et al. 2004).\n3.

Whiteley-Index-7: The seven-item version of the Whiteley Index, an established hypochondriasis scale first described by Pilowsky, was developed and validated by Christensen et al. (2003) specifically to assess treatment effects.\n5. LEAS: The 'Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale' (Lane and Schwartz 1987, German version: Subic-Wrana et al. 2002) is a projective text based measure that assesses the capacity to describe own emotional experience and the one assumed in others.

The pilot study will also be used to confirm sample size calculations for the main study. The protocol for the pilot study will be identical to the main study, but there will not be a placebo phase and the treatment will not be blinded.\n \nThe main study will be double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study, of approximately 66 patients in  which each patient receives in random order, 4 weeks treatment with either Bendrofluazide 5-10mg daily, Atenolol 50-100mg daily or combination of Bendrofluazide 2.5-5mg and Atenolol 25-50mg daily.  There will be a forced titration from the lower to the higher dose stated half way through each dosing period.  There will be a 1 month placebo wash-out between each dosing period.\n\nAt 0, 2 and 4 weeks of each treatment phase, patients  will attend the Clinical Investigation Ward (CIW), fasting, for performance of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood will be drawn from an intravenous cannula, for the measurements of glucose and insulin at 0, 1 and 2 hours.\n\nBlood pressure will be measured at each study visit using an Omron machine. The patients will also be given a blood pressure machine to take home and will be asked to measure and record their blood pressure at least twice per week. If their blood pressure is under 110/70mmhg or over 160/110mmHg at any time or if the patient has symptoms e.g. headache or dizziness, the patient will be asked to contact study staff. If the blood pressure remains over 160/110 for two measurements, then another antihypertensive therapy may be commenced, or the patient withdrawn from the study. If blood pressure is < 110/70 mmHg with symptoms then a decision may be made to terminate their participation in the study.\n\nThe doses of drugs to be used, while commonly used for angina and oedema, are higher than now commonly used for hypertension.  We expect them to be well tolerated during short term use. These doses have also been chosen because they will enable genetic studies top be performed subsequently in a large number of patients.\n\nProf M Brown and Clinical Pharmacology Unit team has experience of many research studies in the treatment of hypertension.

They will return after 1 week and be re-tested to give baseline values and then allocated to receive either an active muscle stimulator or a cutaneous nerve stimulator (TENS) as control. Two protocols for chronic stimulation are proposed to take account of patient availability for the duration of the study. One will use stimulators for 3 weeks at a time followed by a 1 week rest period. The other will use stimulators for 4 weeks at a time, followed by a 2 week rest period.\n\nAfter stimulation at home for 3 periods of 20 minutes each day for either 3 or 4 weeks, participants will be reassessed. A rest period of 1 or 2 weeks will then be allowed followed by testing to establish whether any treatment-induced changes have reverted. Treatment - muscle stimulation or TENS - will then be resumed for a period of 3 or 4 weeks, followed by reassessment. After a further 1 or 2 week rest period, participants will undergo a final assessment which completes the study.\n\nParticipants in the study will therefore be required to attend on the following occasions:\n\n1. Week 1 - Estimated duration 2 hr 30 min\nAs part of normal clinical evaluation at the Vascular Clinic prior to recruitment, a standard history will have been taken and general medical examination performed. Participants will be given a full explanation of the study including time to read the Patient Information Leaflet and the opportunity to ask any questions. Those who fulfil the selection criteria and give informed consent will be eligible to participate in the study. At the first visit for the study a treadmill test and shuttle walk test will be performed with full arterial assessment and a demonstration of the chair testing method will be given. After a 1 hour break with refreshments, the participants will undergo a formal assessment in the chair. During the break, the participant will be asked to complete the SF 36 questionnaire. Each participant will be issued with a physical activity logger device (a pedometer) and asked to wear it during the day throughout the following week. They will be invited to return after a period of 1 week for randomisation and commencement of treatment.\n\n2. Week 2 - Estimated duration 3 hr\nParticipants will undergo a treadmill test and shuttle walk test with full arterial assessment. There will then be a period of rest for 1 hour with refreshments. Participants will then undergo a chair test. They will also undergo assessment of lower leg vascular function using venous occlusion plethysmography. Participants will then be randomised to a treatment group, either active (stimulation) or placebo (TENS). Following instruction in the use of the device they will be asked to commence treatment the next morning for a period of 3 or 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to hand in the activity logger used during the previous week and complete a Seven Day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire (PARQ). They will then be issued with another physical activity logger device and be asked to wear it during the day throughout the last week of stimulation.\n\n3. Week 5 or 6 - Estimated duration 3 hr\nParticipants will undergo the full testing procedure (treadmill test, shuttle walk test, arterial assessment, chair test, vascular function test) as at week 2 and be asked to complete the SF 36 and PAR questionnaires. They will be instructed to cease treatment for a period of 1 or 2 weeks and proceed with normal daily activities.\n\n4. Week 6 or 8 - Estimated duration 3 hr\nParticipants will undergo the testing procedure as at week 2 and 5/6 including the SF 36 questionnaire but excluding the shuttle walk test. They will be instructed to commence treatment as at week 2, either active muscle stimulation or TENS placebo, for a period of 3 or 4 weeks.\n\n5. Week 9 or 12 - Estimated duration 2 hr 30 min\nParticipants will undergo the testing procedure as at week 6/8 (treadmill test, arterial assessment, chair test, vascular function test) including the SF 36 questionnaire.\n\n6. Week 10 or 14 - Estimated duration 2 hr\nParticipants will undergo a testing session consisting of a chair test and vascular function test and SF36 questionnaire. They will then be discharged from the study.\n\nThe protocols used for assessment of walking ability (treadmill and shuttle walk test) and assessment of arterial status (ABPI5) are used routinely in patient assessment. Stimulators are routinely used in the treatment of patients with a variety of conditions.\nThe protocols for chair testing and assessment of vascular function (blood flow, capillary filtration capacity) are specifically for research purposes.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2004 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14718904 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "c25cfd3d-331f-4f1f-a571-30575e3205e0", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2004-02-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14718904"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder12689-0", "contactId": "Contact50105_12689", "sponsorId": "Sponsor48583"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact50105_12689", "title": "Mr", "forename": "M H", "surname": "Simms", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Vascular Surgery\nSelly Oak Hospital", "city": "Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B29 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)121 627 1627"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor48583", "organisation": "Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder12689-0", "name": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (UK)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "25", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2004-07-22T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "15838383"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Fish oil Inhibition of Stenosis in Haemodialysis grafts study", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "FISH", "studyHypothesis": "Primary Question: \nWill haemodialysis patients who receive oral fish oil capsule supplementation versus placebo capsule supplementation have a lower proportion of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (PTFE) grafts without thrombosis, radiological or surgical intervention within 12 months of creation?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The proportion of PTFE grafts with loss of native patency within 12 months", "secondaryOutcome": "Secondary Endpoints:\n1.
