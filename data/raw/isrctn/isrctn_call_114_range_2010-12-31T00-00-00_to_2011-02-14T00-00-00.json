Substantial information about circumstances (at home, compression only, telephone assisted bystander CPR) is given prior to participant. Outcome is blinded to the participants. After informed consent, participants are guided to a simulation room where the manikin is prepared. Only minimal study staff will have access to the scenario room to avoid distractions. Study staffs assignment is documentation of parameters and not to be involved into bystander CPR. Participants will be staffed with a telephone to call the Emergency Dispatch Center (EDC). In the EDC, a professional emergency dispatcher will be providing verbal prompts via telephone to the bystander. The EMD is randomised to give two different verbal commands: \"compress with 5 cm\" or \"push as hard as you can\". The EMD has to open one opaque envelope per call to be randomised in either control or intervention. Therefore study staff are also blinded to allocation of the bystander.\n\nVerbal prompts, given by the EMD, are following the AMPDS protocol V12.0 for control, advising to \"push 5 cm\".\n\nFor the intervention a slightly adopted AMPDS protocol will be advising \"push as hard as you can\". No other changes will be made onto the protocol. \n\nAnother predefined precondition is that all bystanders are denying rescue breaths. Every participant is performing closed-chest compression for 10 minutes on a slightly modified Resusci Anne\u00ae Manikin (Laerdal, Norway).

The accuracy of the CPAP device in detecting residual events (clear airway apnoea, obstructed airway apnoea, hypopnoea, apnoea hypopnoea index, respiratory effort related arousals and Cheyne Stokes Respiration) will be based on comparisons of the CPAP and the PSG by correlation and agreement using the method of Bland and Altman.

Mixed apnoeas will be classified as central on the PSG recording.

A log transformation of the data may be performed to improve the scatter of the differences as the AHI increases.

Provide psychoeducation about PTSD, as well as a rationale for the child program\n2. Focus on danger perceptions and the way these change after a traumatic incident (with an emphasis on factors such as the possible communication of threat from parent to child and reinforcement of perceptions of danger)\n3.

The principal criticism of internal fixation is the high rate of non-union; up to 30% of patients will have a failure of the fixation leading to revision surgery. We believe that improved fracture healing may lead to a decreased rate of failure of fixation. We therefore propose to investigate strategies to both accelerate fracture healing and improve fixation that may significantly improve outcomes after internal fixation of intracapsular femoral fractures. We will test the clinical effectiveness of the osteoinductive agent platelet rich plasma and conduct a pilot study of a novel fixed-angle fixation system.\n\n1.

The United Kingdom has seen a particularly high incidence of disease. The highest rates of disease are being seen in young children. In anticipation of an influenza pandemic two vaccine manufacturers, Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline, have gained marketing authorisation approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for a pandemic strain vaccine under the \"mockup\" dossier route based on limited clinical trial data for a candidate H5N1 vaccine. This \"mockup\" dossier route for pandemic influenza vaccines allows the submission of a core pandemic dossier during the interpandemic period, which results in the approval of a mockup pandemic vaccine. This is followed by a fast track approval of the pandemic vaccine based on the submission of the pandemic variation when the situation arises. The Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline vaccines have now been modified to cover the novel influenza A H1N1 strain. \n\nGiven the high rates of swine flu disease in children, this age group is likely to particularly benefit from immunisation against this virus, however there are few data on the use of these vaccines in a paediatric population.

The disorder generally manifests itself before the age of 7 and is characterised by symptoms of inattention, impulsive behaviour and hyperactivity. ADHD is generally diagnosed in combination with other psychiatric disorders such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD). \n\nThe trial is two-phased, an elimination phase and a reintroduction phase. \n\nThe objective of the elimination phase is to determine the impact of an elimination diet on the behaviour of a heterogeneous, random group of children with ADHD. The null hypothesis is that there is no effect of treatment (i.e. food elimination) on the behavioural scores of the subjects.  \n\nThe objective of the reintroduction phase is to examine whether Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood testing is useful in children with ADHD and whether the determination of antibodies to specific foods may simplify the diagnostic procedure in children responding to an elimination diet. The null hypothesis is that there is no effect of treatment, i.e. there is no relationship between the level of IgE or IgG antibodies in the blood and the behavioural scores of the subjects.  \n\nPlease note that this is a follow-up study to the previously registered trial entitled 'A randomised, controlled study into the effects of food on the behaviour of young children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder' [ISRCTN47247160] - see http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN47247160. \n\nPlease note that as of 23/09/08 this trial record was updated.

They will receive broad recommendations for a healthy diet. Both groups have to keep an extended diary. The diet group will receive the active treatment, a five weeks elimination diet (week 3 - 9). All major allergen foods, ingredients and/or additives associated with behavioural disorders are eliminated from the diet. The diet basically consists of bread, rice, corn, turkey, lamb, various vegetables and fruits, rice milk with extra calcium, margarine, and pear juice from concentrate. This basis is complemented with specific foods like potatoes, fruits, corn, some sweets and wheat, allowed in limited doses twice a week. Vegetables, fruits, rice and meat are allowed every day. Occasionally the diet will be varied to avoid foods for which the child has a particular craving or dislike. The diet clearly prescribes for each day which products and snacks the child may eat and drink. The diet is adjusted to the individual child in order to take into account the child\u0092s specific food preferences and to leave out all foods which the child does not like. If the diet does not result in any behavioural changes after the first two weeks, the diet will be further restricted in consultation with the parents.

The patient has an appointment with the medical specialist and/or nurse-practitioner every three months during the first year, every six months during the second year, and thereafter once a year until at least five years. A mammography will be taken once a year, if needed supplemented by a breast ultrasound.\n\nIn arms two and four, where the effect of 'telephone follow-up' is studied, follow-up will consist of a first follow-up visit two to six weeks after treatment as usual, to evaluate the acute treatment related side effects. Thereafter, patients will only once a year be seen by either the medical oncologist/surgeon/Nurse-Practitioner (NP) or the radiation oncologist. This visit will be combined with the annual mammography. At the regular follow-up times (i.e. at three, six, nine, and 18 months), the NP will have a telephone interview with the patients. This telephone interview will be done by open discussion, and a semi structured questionnaire, including screening for physical and psychosocial symptoms, and compliance to hormonal therapy (if applicable). In addition, data about the side effects of treatment are collected during this telephone interview.\n \nIn the arms three and four, with an additional group intervention, the patients and their partners will follow the Info-Care Programme (ICP) led by two NPs, within three months of the end of the treatment. This programme, given at a central location in the region, consists of two interactive group sessions of about two to three hours of psycho-education, including mutual contact between participants for sharing. The ICP intervention is aimed at improving perceived behavioural control, and reduction of anxiety.

Based on pathology records, its incidence in Germany is estimated to be about 0.4 per million. On this basis, it has been stated that \u0093clinical studies cannot be done because there are not enough individuals affected by Whipple\u0092s disease\u0094. \n\nConsequently, no prospective controlled trials are available. One retrospective analysis came to the conclusion that co-trimoxazole was more efficient than tetracycline in inducing and in maintaining remission of WD. However, cerebral involvement became evident during continuous treatment with co-trimoxazole in one patient. WD leads to death unless treated with antibiotics. As also in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility data are not yet available for the causative actinomycete Tropheryma Whipplei (TW), antibiotic therapy is empirical. There is no standard treatment for WD based on \u0093hard\u0094 scientific evidence. Since a major problem of WD is cerebral involvement, it has been proposed that treatment should be initiated with high doses of intravenously applied antimicrobials known to penetrate into the central nervous system. \n\nIn a pilot study, antibiotic susceptibility of phylogenetically related bacteria to TW was tested in vitro; 95% of them were susceptible to meropenem and 70% were susceptible to ceftriaxion (unpublished, Maiwald et. al). A randomised comparison of meropenem and ceftriaxon in the treatment of bacterial meningitis showed no significant difference in efficacy. \n\nIn SIMW, therefore, these two antibiotics, both licensed for the treatment of severe infections and both known to penetrate into the central nervous system are compared in randomised order: ceftriaxon versus meropenem or imipenem.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Remission maintained for three years", "secondaryOutcome": "Prospective collection of clinical, immunological, and pathological data concerning diagnosis and course of Whipple's disease.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "The SIMW trial was accepted by the Ethics Committee of the Landes\u00e4rztekammer Mainz before the start of the trial."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN45658456", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N/A"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial.", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Not Specified"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2006-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["Austria", "France", "Germany", "Switzerland"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "def33dff-9820-48cd-ab0f-56bb81baddf4", "name": "DRK-Krankenhaus Neuwied", "address": null, "city": "Neuwied", "state": null, "country": "Germany", "zip": "56564"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "Patients with Whipple-typical macrophages in the duodenal mucosa or elsewhere confirmed by the reference pathologist", "ageRange": "Not Specified", "gender": "Both", "targetEnrolment": "62", "totalFinalEnrolment": null, "totalTarget": "42 for the first and second arms.

Examination of the knee is now one of the commonest musculo-skeletal applications of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  There is evidence that MRI allows accurate assessment of meniscal and ligamentous injuries of the knee.  With explicit clinical indications in selected patients it can avoid an expensive invasive arthroscopy, reducing the waiting times for those who do need one.  However, whether management using MRI affects patients\u0092 quality of life has not been rigorously evaluated.  Hence there is uncertainty about whether recommending open access MRI to avoid hospital referral is appropriate.  This reflects wide variation both in GPs\u0092 access to, and use of MRI, and in associated costs.  Thus the question whether patients presenting to GPs with continuing knee problems should be referred for an MRI scan or directly to an orthopaedic surgeon is crucial to patient management and outcome, and thus to cost-effectiveness. \n\nHypothesis:\n1. To evaluate:\na. whether the early use of MRI through open access affects subsequent diagnosis and management\nb. whether it improves patient outcomes\nc. whether it reduces net costs to the NHS, patients and society\n2.
