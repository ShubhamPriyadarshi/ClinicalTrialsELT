Alteration of sleep quality and quantity can have significant adverse consequences prolonging mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. \n\nProportional assist ventilation (PAV) is a mode of support during which the ventilator pressure is proportional to instantaneous flow and volume and hence to pressure generated by the respiratory muscles. The necessity of regular measurements of respiratory system mechanics imposes a major obstacle on the use of this mode. A software has been developed (PAV+) which automatically adjusts the flow assist (cmH2O/L/sec) and volume assist (cmH2O/L) such as to represent always constant fractions of the measured values of resistance and elastance of the respiratory system6 by applying a 300 msec pause maneuver at random intervals at the end of selected inspirations. It was recently shown that these brief end-inspiratory occlusions do not affect sleep quality or sedation requirements in a selected group of critically ill patients. \n\nParthasarathy and Tobin observed greater sleep fragmentation in critically ill patients during pressure support (PS) than during assist-volume control ventilation with backup rate. Numerous studies have shown that compared to PS, PAV improves the synchrony between patient and ventilator and may thus decrease sleep disruption and improve sleep quality.

In addition, the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings will include rest, musical stimulus, and mismatch negativity parts for studying auditory perception and activations of brain areas.\n3.

Changes in motor function and skills (e.g. overall amount of movement, the range of movement and accuracy in motion) will be measured with Motion capture (MoCap) recording\n5. Music analysis will be conducted by using special computational methods: Music Therapy Toolbox (MTTB) and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) for extracting particular musical features. Analysis is focused on musical interaction between patient and therapist, and to examine if clinical change is mediated by observable and measurable changes in music (such as synchronisation, clarity of pulse etc.). Musical data and special features will be used for complementing the data from MoCap (e.g. velocity on studying the accuracy in motion).\n6.

DCBE was not routinely indicated in the case of a negative incomplete colonoscopy, due to patient's intolerance.\n\n2. Sigmoidoscopy: bowel preparation was limited to a single enema (133 ml of 22% sodium phosphate) self-administered at home two hours before the test. No dietary restriction recommended. Screening undertaken by gastroenterologists in hospital endoscopy units. Aim of the examination: to advance the endoscope beyond the sigmoid-descending colon junction under adequate bowel preparation. Polyps smaller than 10 mm detected during the flexible sigmoidoscopy were removed immediately and sent for histological assessment. Subjects with polyps larger than or equal to 10 mm, as well as those detected with advanced adenomas (see polyp classification) referred for total colonoscopy. Subjects with suspected colorectal cancer or with polyps too large to be removed endoscopically referred for surgery.\n\n3.

The stomach is decompressed with a nasogastric tube and intravenous fluid is administrated. Then oral feeding begins after gastric dysmotility is resolved.\nThe rational of 'nil by mouth' is to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, in addition to providing the anastomosis some time before being stressed by food. In another words, patients are nil per os ('NPO') to prevent early complications (nausea and vomiting) and late complications of an anastomosis such as peritonitis, abscess and sepsis due to leakages of intestinal fluids into peritoneal cavity.\nContrary to the above opinion, there is evidence suggesting early feeding is beneficial.\nIt has been shown in animals that the 'NPO' period reduces the collagen content in anastomosed tissue and diminishes the quality of healing. Whereas feeding reverses mucosal atrophy induced by starvation and increases collagen deposition and strength of the site of anastomosis. Since a great number of GI surgeries are undertaken in malnourished patients, providing them with a chance to increase their depleted collagen storage after surgery is wise. Moreover, there are clinical investigations showing that early feeding is associated with improved wound healing and reduces septic morbidity after abdominal trauma and peritonitis. Some other studies suppose that early feeding minimizes the length of hospitalization. Additionally there are studies suggesting no significant difference in any feeding routes.\nMost of the studies are surgical site specific. But this study takes all GI anastomosis into consideration, which might lead to a more general comment.\nConsidering the lack of data from Iran health providers on the matter, the study may also provide some help to choose more appropriate routes for our patients.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Decreasing the early and late complications as below:\n1.

However the vast majority have been performed under general anaesthetic with its resultant risk and costs.

The potential advantages of performing this technique in the outpatient setting are:\n- The avoidance of general anaesthesia and its associated risks\n- Earlier discharge from hospital\n- Faster return to full mobility and fitness\n- Less time of work\n- Less cost to the patient \n\nWe plan to undertake a randomised controlled trial in order to compare out-patient (OP) and day-care (DC) Thermachoice. We will determine the acceptability, recovery and cost of both procedures. Longer term follow up will be undertaken with validated questionnaires comparing patients' menstrual symptoms before and after the treatment.
