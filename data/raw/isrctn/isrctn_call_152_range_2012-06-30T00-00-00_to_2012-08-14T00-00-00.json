During this operation, there is a high risk for bleeding. Therefore, we will test the drug Stibium D6 in order to evaluate its benefit of reduction of bleeding complications. We also test the blood clotting time in 20min intervals during the operation.\n\nWho can participate? \nWe aim to recruit 136 men, age > 18 years who are scheduled for a transurethral resection of the prostate. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nPatients will be randomly allocated to receive Stibium D6 intravenous (i.v.) or placebo (dummy). During the operation (under anaesthesia), four blood samples are taken at the beginning of the operation as well as after every 20min. Another blood sample will be taken 1 and 2 days after surgery, respectively. A control examination in our outpatient clinics will be 2 weeks after the operation. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere could be a direct benefit to those taking part and getting the real drug regarding bleeding complications. If the drug has a beneficial effect on blood clotting, there should be benefits to future patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate. Eventually, the drug could be used in surgical interventions other than transurethral resection of the prostate..\nThe main risk of the intervention is the extra samples of blood that has to be taken. However, the amount of blood is very small. There is no risk for iron deficiency and the related anaemia because of the blood samples. So far, there is no known risk of administering Stibium D6.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe study has been set up by the Urology Department of the University of Bern. \n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nIt is anticipated that recruitment will start July 2012.

Evidence based data comparing hyperbaric prilocaine 2% versus hyperbaric mepivacaine 4% for perianal surgery does not exist. In this trial we compare the expansion of low dose spinal anaesthesia, the incidence of transient neurological symptoms (TNS) and the duration of stay in hospital comparing 0.5ml hyperbaric prilocaine 2% vs. 0,5ml hyperbaric mepivacaine 4%.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims\nMinor colorectal diseases such as condyloma (infection of the genitals), fissures or haemorrhoids are very common amongst the adult population. \u2028If surgical treatment is necessary, procedures are usually performed in an ambulatory setting (outpatient surgery/day care). Spinal anaesthesia with small amounts of hyperbaric local anaesthetics seems to be more efficient than other anaesthesia techniques. In July 2010, prilocaine 2%, a new hyperbaric local anaesthetic, was introduced to the market. Compared to formerly used mepivacaine, prilocaine seems to have a shorter time of drug-action and a lower rate of adverse side effects. Therefore prilocaine 2% may be the preferred anaesthetic for perianal outpatient surgery. \u2028The aim of this study is to compare prilocaine and mepivacaine regarding adverse side effects, amount of additional analgesics needed as well as the duration of patient\u0092s stay in day care.\n\nWho can participate?\nEvery patient suffering from minor colorectal diseases aged 18 to 80 can take part in this study, except for patients who have the following:  contraindications against spinal anaesthesia, not eligible for day surgery,  allergies against local anaesthetics or drugs used for postoperative analgesia.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nParticipants are randomly allocated to either 0.5ml of hyperbaric prilocaine 2% or 0.5ml of hyperbaric mepivacaine 4%. The expansion of sensory and motor blocks are tested. After the procedure, the period of time until the patient is able to void (pass urine), to get up and walk without assistance as well as the time span until the patient is eligible for discharge are evaluated. The occurence of pain as well as the amount of postoperative analgesics needed are documented. One week after the operation, there is a telephone interview with the patient. This includes questions about the occurence of transient neurologic symptoms (a symmetrical bilateral pain in the back or buttocks or pain radiating to the lower extremities after recovery from spinal anesthesia) or postpunctural headache. The interviewer also assesses the patient`s overall satisfaction concerning anaesthesia.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThere will be no immediate direct benefit to those taking part. But there should be benefits to future patients undergoing minor perianal surgery in an ambulatory setting by establishing a drug with fewer adverse side effects for this purpose. Both drugs compared in this study are well established. There are no furthers risks than those of regular spinal anaesthesia in an ambulatory setting.\n \nWhere is the study run from?\nThe study has been set up by the Department of Anaesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim.\n\nWhen is the study starting?\nThe study started at the day surgery centre, University Medical Centre Mannheim  on July 26 2011.

The excretion rates were compared to baseline (non-consumption) and to each other. The safety was evaluated with pre and post testing of blood counts, chemistry, as well as liver and kidney function. It was possible to observe the capability of different zeolite preparations to increase the excretion of heavy metals from the human body in a safe manner. The effectiveness of three different zeolite preparations was observed.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims? \nHeavy metal toxicity is a burden on everyone. Toxic buildup causes numerous health issues from cancer to autism and anything in between.  Zeolite has been used in the past to remove heavy radioactive metals from land, water and humans.  The focus of this study was to prove zeolite is effective at safely removing heavy metals from your body.\n\nWho can participate? \nAnyone over the age of 18 was eligible to participate in the study. The only people that were not allowed to participate were those using heavy metal based medications (such as lithium). The participation period is over and there will be no further recruitment for this trial. Participants were asked to stop eating seafood before and during the trial because of the high presence of metals that may interfere with the results.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThree different zeolite products were used to see how well each worked.  Two liquid products (1 drop and 1 spray) and one powder product were compared.  20 subjects were split to three groups, 10 on the powdered product, 5 on the liquid product and 5 on the spray product. Each participant stayed on the treatment for 6 days to show how effective the products are. Then all of the participants were put on the highest levels of the powdered product for four weeks to confirm the safety of zeolite for human consumption. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nParticipants were expected to see lower toxicity levels and experience an overall healthier feeling after taking zeolite. Side effects were not expected, but minor bloating occurred with one patient.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nLipogenex Anti-Aging Center in Scottsdale, Arizona. \n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study took place from January 2012 through March 2012.\n\nWho is funding the study? \nThe Zeolite Trial Ethics Committee sponsored the study and was responsible for any costs that were associated with it. \n \nWho is the main contact? \nDr. Emmanouil Karampahtsis\nmanolisnmd@yahoo.com", "primaryOutcome": "Efficacy - Measures excretion levels of heavy metals for each subject on zeolite preparations compared to their baseline output through urinalysis and blood tests", "secondaryOutcome": "Safety and Toxicology - Patients were told to report any adverse reactions.

All subjects were placed on an all-seafood restricted diet for a week prior to the study and during the time of the study, until they completed all urine measurements for heavy metals. This measure was taken as a control in order to prevent any new contamination that might alter the excretion rates between subjects. All subjects received a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel (blood test) as a baseline assessment prior to onset of the study. This measure was taken to compare results after the consumption of zeolite to assess safety. Each subject received a six hour timed urine collection and analysis for heavy metals as a baseline to assess the levels of metals their body is able to excrete without the help of any chelating agent. \n\nGroup A (10 subjects) stayed on one scoop (5 grams) of Zeolite Pure powder (by ZEO Health) for 5 days.

All subjects were told to report any adverse events or symptoms during the time of study. Subjects received a blood test at the end of the four weeks to evaluate any potential impact of zeolite on blood, chemistry, liver and kidney function values. Subjects were not tested for excretion of heavy metals during the higher consumption of 15 grams of Zeolite Pure powder (by ZEO Health).\n\nGroup B (10 subjects) were given randomly either the zeolite oral spay (ACZ Nano extra strength by Results RNA) or the zeolite oral drops (Natural Cellular Defense by Waiora). Subjects took the higher recommended dose by the companies for 5 days. Five subjects took 8 sprays three times per day of the ACZ Nano extra Strength (by Results RNA) and five subjects took 10 drops three times per day of the Natural Cellular Defense (by Waiora).

After the blood test was performed subjects were placed on a seven day break from all zeolite so as the body to return to the baseline state of excretion. All subjects in group B continued avoiding all seafood to prevent any recent contamination during the study.\n\nGroup B subjects after the seven day break from all zeolite supplements were given the Zeolite Pure powder (by ZEO Health) one scoop (5 grams) per day for 5 days. This was done in order to compare effectiveness of the two products on the same subjects. We wanted to observe if the Zeolite Pure powder had any stronger chelating properties on the same subjects compared to the other two supplements. On the 6th day, while taking the one scoop of powder, a urine collection test was performed as before (six hours timed while drinking two litters of water). Urine samples were analyzed by Genova Diagnostics. All subjects in group B stayed on Zeolite Pure powder higher dose of three scoops (15 grams) for total of four weeks to evaluate the safety of the product.

Exercise has positive effects on many cardiovascular risk factors, and it can significantly reduce the components of metabolic syndrome. The main challenge with exercise, is how to motivate the patients to change and increase their exercise habits. Our aim is to modify the exercise habits of men in early middle age. \n\nWho can participate?\nMen aged 35 to 45 years with a high cardiovascular risk (with at least two risk factors). We plan to recruit 300 participants in a two year period. \n\nWhat does the study involve?\nWe aim to modify the exercise habits of men in early middle age. The men will be allocated to either health promotion led by a public health nurse, or group exercise with health promotion led by a general practitioner. We predict that the treatments will have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk level and physical activity of the men, which are the main outcomes of the study. We will examine the effect of the two treatments on the individual risk factors of metabolic syndrome (e.g. weight, waist circumference, blood cholesterol level) and on the physical activity factors. The results of this study will help to plan the treatments used in future to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe possibility to start physical training in a socially convenient surrounding with same-aged men having similar type of health problems. Main risk is that present intervention may not be strong enough to induce health benefits.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nThe study will be run in Vantaa city, Finland by University of Helsinki and health authorities of Vantaa city.\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study will start on 01 August 2012 and it will end 2015.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nVantaa City,  University of Helsinki and Yrj\u00f6 Jahnssons Foundation. \n\nWho is the main contact?\nTimo Kauppila\ntimo.kauppila@helsinki.fi", "primaryOutcome": "1.

Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Their quality of life is severely affected, some live in a constant fear of another attack. We can significantly improve the health of future generations, if we can prevent the development of these diseases. It is therefore important to devise effective preventive strategies. It is well known that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of asthma and allergy. Thus, children with a family history of allergy are at higher risk. Exposure to allergens in early childhood may be one of the most important environmental factors. \n\nIn 1990 we embarked on a study to test the effectiveness of strict dietary avoidance of food allergens combined with reduced exposure to house dust-mite allergen. Infants, at higher risk due to family predisposition, were recruited before birth and assigned randomly to prophylactic (n = 58) or control (n = 62) groups. Prophylactic group infants were either breast-fed with mothers on a low allergen diet or given hypoallergenic milk formula and exposure to house dust-mite was reduced. All 120 children have been seen at ages 1, 2, 4 and 8 years. The prophylactic children were less sensitised to allergens and developed less asthma and eczema up to the age of 8 years and there was no loss of preventive effect up to this age. \n\nSince this study commenced in 1990, no other intervention has succeeded in achieving such an impact on asthma and allergy. These children are now 18 years.

These developments have led to a redesign of the Maastricht Heuvelland Stroke Service in 2006. The essentials of this redesign are: stroke patients will be admitted to the University Hospital in Maastricht for a maximum of 5 days for diagnosis, early intervention and stabilisation, after which they are discharged to a special assessment and rehabilitation ward in a nursing home. In this nursing home, stroke patients undergo a structured multidisciplinary assessment, lasting a maximum of 5 days, and take part in their first rehabilitation activities. During assessment, the appropriate follow-up treatment is determined. Patients are then admitted to the follow up setting for rehabilitative care. (Cost)-effective integrated stroke care requires a high degree of coordination between professionals in hospitals, nursing homes and home care, a high quality integral assessment in the nursing home and a system of adequately timed patient transitions. The main hypothesis is that the redesigned process of the Stroke Service Maastricht Heuvelland will lead to (cost)-effective care with expected improvement of quality. \n\nThe research questions in this study are: \n1. What is the effect of early admission to and assessment in the nursing home on functional outcomes, quality of life, and satisfaction with care compared to usual care by a stroke service? [Effect evaluation]\n2. From a societal perspective, what is the incremental cost-effectiveness of early admission to and assessment in the nursing home compared to usual care in a stroke service? [Economic evaluation]\n3. What are the experiences and opinions of patients and professionals about the newly developed care pathway?

Within the cost-utility analysis, outcomes will be measured by means of standard Dutch version of the Euroqol (EQ-5D).

In 2007 the Cancer Reform Strategy announced that from 2012 the NHS Breast Screening Programme would be extended to cover women between the ages of 47 and 73. This means that all women will get two extra screening invitations in their lifetime. It also means that all women will get their first invitation before age 50. As capacity does not allow for full immediate roll out across the whole of England, the age extension will be phased-in with full coverage from 2012. Randomising this phasing-in would provide unbiased evidence on the extent to which it is beneficial to extend the age range for breast screening and whether an extra screen at younger or older ages is more worthwhile. To date there is no clear evidence on this as no trial has looked at the added value of one extra screen within an existing screening programme.

Oxepa is a complete balanced liquid feed containing omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) and antioxidants (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] = 0.51g per 100 ml, docosahexaneoic acid [DHA] = 0.22 g per 100 ml and Vitamin E = 21.4 mg per 100 ml). The energy density is 1.5 kcal/ml with a protein content of 6.25 g/100ml. There is no free arginine or glutamine in this feed.\n\nArm 2: standard enteral nutrition (SEN) -\nThis group received a standard nutritional formula (Ensure plus), seven days pre- and post-operatively. This is an isonitrogenous, isocaloric enteral feed without immunonutrients \n\nArm 3: control -\nThis group received no pre-operative nutritional support. Post-operatively, patients received nutritional support according to clinical requirements and consultant preference. Patients in this arm received Omolite which has no immunonutrients and lower energy and protein. \n\nClinical management:\nAll patients underwent surgical resection for upper gastrointestinal cancers. Patients with unresectable disease were withdrawn from the trial. Either nasojejunal tubes or feeding jejunostomy (Freka 9 Fr or silastic Foley 12 Fr) were inserted into the proximal jejunum at the time of the operation. Routine blood investigations (full blood count [FBC], urea and electrolytes [U+Es], liver function tests [LFTs] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured seven and one days pre- and post-operatively. Fresh blood samples were transported on ice. They were then separated into plasma, red blood cells and lymphocytes into Ependorfs. Subsequently, all samples were stored in a -800\u00b0C freezer prior to analysis.\n\nAfter recruitment into the study all patients underwent a standardised nutritional assessment by one of two qualified dieticians. The assessments included:\n1. Weight (kg) and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m^2), seven and one days pre-, seven days post-operatively and on discharge\n2. Percentage unintentional weight loss three months prior to surgery measured objectively\n3. Full dietary assessment using 24 hour recall\n4. Anthropometry (Jejeebhoy and Keith 2005): measurements were taken seven days pre-operatively, 7 and 14 days post-operatively:\n4.1. Triceps skin fold thickness (TSF): this provides an estimate of the subcutaneous fat deposit and therefore can be used to estimate the amount of total body fat. Skinfold callipers (John Bull, British Indicators Ltd) were used in mm on the underside of the mid-point of the non-dominant upper arm, with the arm hanging loosely at the side and skin-fold parallel to the longitudinal axis of the arm.\n4.2. Mid arm circumference (MMC) was measured by tape measure midway between the acromid process and the olecranon process of the non-dominant arm, with the patient's arm relaxed and hanging downwards\n4.3. Mid-arm muscle circumference (Thomas and Bishop 2007): the following equation was used: \n\nMAMC (cm) = MMC (cm) -  [pi x TSF (mm)]\n\nThe fat-free mass is a combination of lean tissue (protein), water, and minerals. Since muscle is the major protein store it has been used to estimate the protein reserves of the body. MAMC and mid-arm muscle area (MAMA) provide a measure of muscle mass which is correlated with measures of total muscle mass and therefore protein status.\n\nPre-operative feeding:\nAll patients were advised to consume standard food and fluids pre-operatively and to follow their current eating plan. Pre-operative feeding was carried as outpatient therapy for seven days prior to surgery in those in the IED and SEN arms. The desired volume of enteral nutrition was 675 ml daily. The amount of artificial feed consumed was recorded in a specially designed diary. Patients were admitted to the clinical ward on the day prior to surgery. \n\nPost-operative feeding:\nA feeding jejunostomy or a fine bore nasojejunal tube was placed intra-operatively to allow post-operative enteral feeding. Patients followed the following feeding regime: \nDay 1: feeding access flushed 25 ml four hourly for the first 12 hours, progressing to 25 ml/hour sterile water infusion using the quantium pump\nDay 2: Commenced 25 ml/hour of feed\nDay 3: Increased to 50 ml/hour of feed and to reach desired maximum rate\nDays 4 - 7:\tContinued feed at the maximum rate\nDay 8: If feed was required to continue after day seven, the feed was changed to a standard feed (Osmolite or Jevity)\n\nPatients reached their maximum rate depending on clinical progress on an individual basis. It was not considered harmful to reach the maximum rate between three to seven days. All patients were allowed oral fluids proceeding to receive semi-solid and then normal diet as soon as this was clinically indicated and tolerated. Oesophagectomy patients were continued at a maximum rate till they were started on a soft diet (usually days 9 or 10). Patients who managed oral diet were converted to receiving overnight feeds only for two to three days. Intravenous blood and fluid replacement was continued as clinically required. Nasojejunal tubes were usually removed in total gastrectomy patients between days 8 to 10. Feeding jejunostomy were reviewed at a combined dietician/upper gastrointestinal nurse specialist clinic, two weeks following discharge, and removed generally provided that patients were meeting their nutritional requirements. \n\nEnergy requirements were calculated on an individual basis, at the start of the trial, by two experienced senior dieticians using equations for estimating basal metabolic rate. This provided guidelines on the nutritional requirements for adults requiring enteral nutrition by determining basal metabolic rate (BMR), adjusting for stress or weight loss and added a combined factor for activity and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Nitrogen requirements were also calculated at the same time. Patients were considered to be in a hypermetabolic state so the nitrogen was calculated as 0.2 g/kg/day (Elia 1990).\n\nThe only violation to this protocol was in cases of chylothorax which may have been a consequence of thoracic duct injury, failure of ligation at surgery or duplicate ducts. This usually presented seven days after surgery when the patient had commenced oral intake, especially of fat-containing nutrients. Conservative management involved changing the enteral feed to one with medium-chain triglycerides to help decrease chylous loss. In the need for surgical intervention, a pre-exploratory intake of enteral fat (Peptac) was used to help locate the leaking duct.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2012 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22237467 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "e3c520d5-8032-49ed-9f41-55c46b3c2e0a", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22237467"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder17585-0", "Funder17585-1"], "contactId": "Contact55552_17585", "sponsorId": "Sponsor54131"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55552_17585", "title": "Prof", "forename": "S Michael", "surname": "Griffin", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Professor of Gastrointestinal Surgery\nThe Northern Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Unit (NOGCU)\nRoyal Victoria Infirmary\nQueen Victoria Road", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NE14LP", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)191 282 0240"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "michael.griffin@nuth.nhs.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor54131", "organisation": "The Northern Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Unit (NOGCU) (UK)", "website": "http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sars/research/css/nogcu.htm", "sponsorType": "Research organisation", "contactDetails": {"address": "c/o Professor S.M.Griffin MD FRCS\nRoyal Victoria Infirmary\nQueen Victoria Road", "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NE1 4LP", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder17585-0", "name": "The Northern Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Unit (NOGCU) (UK) - Professor SM Griffin", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder17585-1", "name": "The Newcastle Healthcare Charity (the Trustees) (UK) - \u00a310,000 awarded for consumables", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-07-05T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "23", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2008-12-04T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "93336504"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Effects of wholegrain components on metabolic biomarkers: a four-week intervention study in 'at risk' subjects", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "Long-term consumption of bran-rich cereal products impacts favourably on risk factors for heart disease and metabolic syndrome in apparently healthy, 'at risk' men and women.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Changes in plasma homocysteine (a risk marker for CHD) attributable to treatment during the intervention, measured at baseline and 4 weeks.", "secondaryOutcome": "Changes in other risk markers for disease attributable to treatments during the intervention:\n1.

Pulmonary rehabilitation has been consistently effective in improving exercise capacity and health status in patients with COPD and is now recommended as part of the management of such individuals. Recently there has been interest in the systemic effects of COPD including peripheral muscle weakness that is a limiting factor to exercise in patients with COPD. Specific stimulation of these muscles may improve their metabolic and physiological function and thus alleviate premature exercise termination as a result of peripheral muscle fatigue. This may then allow greater benefits to be obtained during pulmonary rehabilitation in terms of both exercise tolerance and health status.\n\nSecondary research questions are as follows:\n1. Is it feasible to carry out NMES at the same time as pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD?\n2. Does the benefit depend on the severity of disease?\n3. Does the benefit depend on the baseline physiological status or strength of the peripheral skeletal muscles?\n4.

Walking distance (incremental shuttle walking test [ISWT] distance)\n4. Respiratory muscle strength (Pi max and Pe max)*\n5. Hand grip strength (HGS)*\n\nAssessment Day 3:\n1. Quadriceps force*\n2. Calf muscle blood flow capacity*\n\nPulmonary Rehabilitation Programme:\nPatients will attend the programme three times weekly for a period of 8 weeks. During each visit they are required to exercise for 45 minutes at an intensity of 80% of their peak oxygen uptake. Thus all patients receive a protocol that is individualised to their exercise capacity. The duration and intensity of exercise is gradually increased from 30 to 45 minutes over the first 2 - 3 weeks of the programme in order to provide a gradation of work over the initial training sessions. An interval training approach is adopted where appropriate in order to allow patients with excessive dyspnoea to recover between excessive bouts, e.g. patients exercise for 4 minutes and then have 1 minute rest. N.B. In some patients it may be difficult to achieve 30 minutes in the first exercise session therefore patients may start at 20 minutes and then build up. Similarly, not all patients will achieve 45 minutes at the end of the programme. The exercise performed will be aerobic training using a combination of cycling, walking (treadmill) and stepping. Patients will attend the hospital in small groups of two or three and rotate around the equipment during the 45 minute session, e.g. 15 minutes on each exercise modality. Patients that show significant oxygen desaturation (greater than 4% to less than 90%) will be given supplemental oxygen during the training in order to maintain the saturation above 90% and to prevent excessive dyspnoea that may limit training.\n\nNeuromuscular electrical stimulation and sham stimulation:\nActive electrical stimulation will be applied to the quadriceps and calf (muscles of both legs) using Neurotech NT2000 programmable portable constant voltage muscle stimulators (Biomedical Research Ltd., Ireland) for a total of 8 weeks. Each quadriceps muscle will be stimulated for 15 minutes per day at a frequency of 50 Hz on three days of the week. On three alternate days of the week, the calves will be stimulated twice daily at a frequency of 8 Hz for 15 minutes. During stimulation, patients will be advised to be seated with the foot resting flat on the floor in order to provide some\nresistance load to the contracting muscle. The stimulators record usage as a measure of compliance and patients will be given a diary to record date, time and level stimulation output. For sham stimulation, stimulators will be programmed to deliver pulses at high frequency (90 Hz) but short duration which provides a tingling sensation but no active muscle contraction and controls for placebo effect.\n\nPlease note that this trial was stopped because of poor recruitment and staff shortages.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder17108-0", "contactId": "Contact55069_17108", "sponsorId": "Sponsor53634"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55069_17108", "title": "Dr", "forename": "B", "surname": "Cooper", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Respiratory Medicine\nSelly Oak Hospital", "city": "Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B29 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor53634", "organisation": "Record Provided by the NHSTCT Register - 2007 Update - Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "The Department of Health,\nRichmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder17108-0", "name": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust (UK) - NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "22", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2007-09-28T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "73517077"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Positive Psychology Interventions in Patients with Advanced Cancer", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "To see if simple positive psychology interventions will improve well being and quality of life in persons with advanced cancer.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Well being", "secondaryOutcome": "Quality of life, functioning.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN73517077", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N0544187603"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Quality of life"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2006-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2007-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "83b1f756-296b-47a7-90b9-401ac05ad15a", "name": "Palliative Care Team", "address": null, "city": "Cambridge", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB2 2QQ"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.

This is because the vein grafts themselves become blocked like the original coronary arteries. Many attempts have been made to prevent these late failures either by variations in surgical technique or by using drugs, however the problem remains. Based on a British Heart Foundation funded collaboration between basic scientists and cardiac surgeons stretching over the past 10 years, a radically new therapy has been devised.  This involves wrapping the vein in a stocking-like material during the bypass operation so that it will be continuously supported during its life as a graft.  In experimental studies,this has had a dramatic effect in reducing the thickening of the graft wall. The present project will be the first test of the effectiveness of the new technique in man.\n\nHypothesis:\nApplication of a highly porous non-restrictive external stent to autologous saphenous veins at the time of implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts will reduce graft thickening and neointima formation and increase lumen size.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Study endpoints:  Graft wall thickness and luminal size using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at time of operation and at follow-up.
