The content of the programme included dementia diseases, symptoms, treatment and related complications, fall prevention, prevention and treatment of delirium, interaction and communication in dementia care and negative effects of, alternatives to and legislation directing the use of physical restraints. \n\nFirst, the head-nurse at each intervention unit selected one person who underwent the whole education programme compressed during two seminar days. Remaining staff received their education via 30-minute videotaped lectures. Three of the lectures also included a clinical written vignettes forming the basis for group discussions. At each unit it was up to the staff to make arrangements for watching the films and if desired to arrange group discussions. Each unit was responsible for making arrangements for taking part of the lectures and if desired to arrange group discussions. The education programme ran alongside ordinary work at the units without further involvement of the researchers besides distribution of the video taped lectures and data collection. In the education programme the emphasis was on the importance of investigating the underlying causes instead of working in a symptom-oriented manner e.g. a resident that have sustained a fall accident should be investigated for the cause of the fall instead of just using physical restraints. The staff was encouraged to use physical restraints only as the last resort.

They should find about 30 minutes a day for uninterrupted play\n3. Training unit 3 goal: Being aware of one's own feelings and thoughts\nABC scheme for emotional regulation and de-escalation - parents should analyse difficult everyday situations in terms of the thinking patterns associated with them and distinguish between beneficial and dysfunctional patterns\n4. Training unit 4 goal: Breaking fixed routines\nChanging dysfunctional everyday routines, modifying situational contingencies - parents learn to restructure recurring everyday situations (e.g., going to bed, mealtimes, homework) in a more positive way\n5. Training unit 5 goal: Showing how actions have consequences\nStrengthening prosocial behaviour, avoiding reinforcement traps - parents learn to provide effective and behaviour-related consequences (reinforcement, punishment)\n6. Training unit 6 goal: Making effective demands\nSetting clear rules and making demands correctly - parents practice formulating and communicating demands\n7. Refresher session goal: Looking Back on the Way Forward\nProblem-solving behaviour in the family, structuring in the family - parents review what has been achieved so far and specify unresolved problems.

Importantly, in this stroke model PAT not only prevents infections, it also improves survival and outcome, significantly. \n\nThe following primary hypothesis shall be tested: \n1. PAT with Moxifloxacin reduces the incidence of complicating infections after (primary aim)\n\nSecondary aims: \n2.  PAT also reduces the infarct volume and improves the neurological outcome\n3.
