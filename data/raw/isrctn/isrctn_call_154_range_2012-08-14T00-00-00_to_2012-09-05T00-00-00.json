Return to work, pain and disability improve more in sick-listed subjects with shoulder or neck pain if they receive a hospital-based multidisciplinary team-intervention in addition to a brief intervention than in subjects who only receive the brief intervention consisting of a clinical examination and advice given by a rehabilitation doctor and a physiotherapist\n2. Pain and muscle strength improves more if these patients receive instructions on homebased exercise programs with strength training than if they receive instructions on exercise programs without strength training", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims\nIn 2005 33% of the Danish adult population reported pain or discomfort in the shoulder and/or neck within a period of 14 days.  Employees often take sick leave because of musculoskeletal symptoms. Previous studies have indicated efficacy that both brief and more comprehensive multidisciplinary interventions work. However, it remains unknown which works best and which elements are important to facilitate return to work and improve health. For instance, there is moderate evidence for exercise in the treatment of acute and chronic non-specific neck pain, but it is unknown whether exercise should include strength training. The objectives of the present study are 1) to compare return to work (RTW), pain and disability in subjects offered a hospital-based multidisciplinary intervention or a brief intervention and 2) to compare the effects of two different home-based exercise programs on pain and muscle strength in patients on sick-leave for 4-16 weeks due to symptoms of the neck and/or shoulder. \n\nWho can participate? \nPatients are referred to the hospital clinic by general practitioners if they have been on sick leave for 4-16 weeks due to unspecific pain in the neck or shoulder and are not expected to have surgery. They are 18-60 years of age, understand Danish, are not pregnant and are not substance abusers. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThe brief intervention comprises clinical examination and advice offered by a rehabilitation doctor and a physiotherapist. In the multidisciplinary intervention, this intervention is supplemented with the expertise of a team and the assignment of a case manager who makes a rehabilitation plan in collaboration with the patient and the multidisciplinary team. \nThe clinical examination is carried out by the doctor, relevant imaging and examinations are ordered and treatment options are discussed. Information is given in a reassuring way and medical pain management is adjusted. The participants are advised to resume work when possible. The physiotherapy examination included a standardized, mechanical evaluation before advice on exercise is given. General advice is given to increase physical activity and exercise. In order to ensure coordination between stakeholders, copies of the medical records are always sent to the patient, the general practitioner and the municipal social services responsible for reimbursement of sick leave compensation. For all patients, a follow-up visit at the physiotherapist is scheduled two weeks later, and a follow-up visit at the doctor is arranged for patients needing answers in relation to test results. \nAfter the initial clinical examination the patients are randomly allocated to brief or multidisciplinary intervention and to one of two exercise programs. The exercise programs are instructed by the physiotherapist, who recommends general exercise at least 3 times per week for all patients and additional strength training using rubber bands for the strength training group.\nPatients allocated to the multidisciplinary intervention group are scheduled for an interview with a case manager two weeks later. The interview is standardised and includes questions about work history, private life and questions on how pain and disability is perceived. The patient is seen once or more times by the case manager depending on need and progress. The case manager and the patient make a tailored rehabilitation plan aiming at full or partial RTW. If this is unrealistic, a plan towards staying on the job market in other ways is made, for instance by jobs supported by the social system. Each case is discussed several times by the entire multidisciplinary team including the rehabilitation doctor, a specialist in clinical social medicine, a physiotherapist, a social worker and an occupational therapist. Appointments with other members of the team and meetings at the work place or at the social service centre are regularly arranged. The case manager keeps in contact with the participant and problems are discussed at regular team conferences where the participant is not present. The case is closed when the participant resumes work or no later than three months after the first visit. Three different peoples can be assigned as case manager (the specialist in clinical social medicine, the social worker or the occupational therapist). Every two weeks, supervision of the entire team is arranged for 1-2 hours by a former general practitioner specialized in cognitive therapy to ensure a standardized intervention.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere is no extra risk to the patients except for the potential discomfort associated with strength training. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nSpine Centre, Regional Hospital Silkeborg, Denmark.\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study was initiated in 2009 and should continue until 350 patients are enrolled by referral general practitioners to the Spine Centre, Regional Hospital Silkeborg, Denmark. \n\nWho is funding the study? \nThe evaluation of the study is financed by the Danish Working Environment Research Fund.\n\nWho is the main contact? \nChris Jensen\nchris.jensen@stab.rm.dk", "primaryOutcome": "Comparison of brief versus multidisciplinary intervention:\n1.

Current methods of blood inventory management are to issue the oldest blood first to limit outdating. However, data from experimental and observational studies suggest that red cells stored for longer periods might lead to adverse outcomes, including an increase in mortality. The only way to answer this question is to undertake a randomised controlled trial (RCT). If such a trial showed a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in mortality with freshest available versus standard issue red cells, it is likely to lead to major changes in the management of red cell inventories and storage methods to increase the use of fresher red cells. Such a large pragmatic trial is complex; hence before initiating a large trial it is important to work out logistics and show feasibility. Our proposed pilot study will provide crucial information for the design of a large RCT that will yield reliable and precise estimates of the effect of freshest available versus standard-issue red cells on in-hospital mortality.\n\nFurther reading:\nDuration of red cell storage before transfusion and in-hospital mortality.

At present, World Health Organization (WHO) led control activities in Africa mainly rely on mass administration of microfilaricidal drugs, with a measure of success. However, it has become clear that new, complementary therapies, ideally being macrofilaricidal, must be developed for sustainable control. \n\nIn lymphatic filariasis (LF), there is the additional need to deliver new therapies for lymphatic pathology, i.e. lymphoedema and urogenital pathology such as hydrocele and lymphocele, which are not targeted by current mass drug administrations. Depletion of Wolbachia essential endosymbionts of filariae with doxycycline, an approach established by our group, resulted in macrofilaricidal activity in LF. The present study hypothesises that Wolbachia also play a major role in inducing and maintaining lymphatic pathology, and that doxycycline may therefore improve lymphoedema. \n\nThe aim of this project is:\n1. To analyse to what extent lymphoedema is caused by Wolbachia. To this, the Wolbachia-depleting antibiotic doxycycline will be compared with amoxicillin, which does not target Wolbachia but only opportunistic exogenous bacteria that may worsen lymphoedema.\n2.

Exercises:\nTherapeutic exercises will be delivered by fitness professionals at Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI) accredited gyms in local authority leisure centres under the mentorship of specialist physiotherapists in Oxfordshire (Jane Freebody, Charlotte Winward) and Birmingham (Nicola Brittle). Physiotherapists will be supported by the research team Dr Helen Dawes in Oxfordshire and Dr Andrew Soundy in Birmingham.  \n\nDetails of the IFI initiative are available at http://www.inclusivefitness.org/. This is an initiative aimed at increasing participation under the auspices of the English Federation of Disability Sport supported in 2001 by grant of \u00a31 million from the Sport England Lottery Fund towards a total project cost of \u00a31.3 million. Local authority partners contributed further funding of \u00a30.3 million. IFI facilities offer a wide range of benefits to disabled customers, including: 'Facilities that have undertaken both physical and communication access improvements, staff that have a high level of training, an opportunity to exercise in a truly inclusive environment and access to healthy lifestyle choices'. \n\nAs part of the intervention participants will be assessed by the fitness professional for a suitable programme and a profile created taking into consideration each participant's family, social background, their hopes, health and fitness needs. An intervention will be created to address participant's requirements. Interventions will typically include components of endurance, muscle strength, flexibility and cardiovascular fitness. Exercise sessions will normally last up to one hour and components be programmed at an appropriate intensity, duration, frequency and progression according to exercise prescription principals. \n\n2. The Physical Activity Support System (PASS):\nThe PASS will include information, practical advice and physical support from a physiotherapist for both the participants with neurological conditions and the health and fitness professionals involved in physical activity provision. A physiotherapist will provide support so that therapeutic exercises of the participant's choice can be safely and effectively delivered.\n\nEach participant will be supported by the physiotherapist at their initial fitness assessment and up to 5 subsequent attendances, though this number of sessions may vary between participants. It is expected the number of support sessions will be an integral aspect of measuring the support system. A physiotherapist will then provide the fitness trainer and participant with phone/web based contact as required. \n\nParticipants will receive full reimbursement for transport and gym costs for their attendance during the three-month intervention period.

RA is characterised by inflammation of the synovial lining membrane of affected joints and causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in joints that may lead to deformity and permanent joint damage. Patients also often feel generally unwell, are fatigued and may have a poor quality of life. In some there may be severe disability; though outcomes vary greatly and early use of effective treatments is important for reducing the impact of disease. Disease can be effectively suppressed, but not cured, by Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulphasalazine, gold, and newer agents such as the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitors. Prolonged use of DMARDs is usually necessary in RA. Therefore drugs that are most effective are those which are more likely to be continued over many years. Observations of groups of people with RA show that methotrexate, which is now regarded as the standard against which new drugs should be compared, is more likely to be continued after several years than other older DMARDs.\n\nRandomised clinical trials of DMARDs rarely follow patients for more than 6 months and infrequently compare one DMARD with another. Modern management of RA has changed enormously because of TNF inhibitors but these new drugs are expensive, have potentially serious adverse effects and are subject to NICE guidance which restricts their use to patients with certain characteristics. Three drugs are available: adalimumab (Humira\u00ae), etanercept (Enbrel\u00ae) and infliximab (Remicade\u00ae). Adalimumab and etanercept are self-administered by subcutaneous injection at home and therefore offer greater convenience. Infliximab is given as an intravenous drip and administered in hospital: patients need to attend hospital as day-cases. These drugs also differ in important ways on their mechanism of action: adalimumab and infliximab are monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF and etanercept is a TNF receptor antagonist. All three TNF inhibitors have been assessed in high quality randomised controlled clinical trials and shown to be highly effective and comparable to methotrexate. However no trials have compared any one of these agents against another. Some indirect comparisons, using data from randomised trials, indicate that the drugs may be similarly efficacious; however recent data suggests that this may not be the case (see below).\n\nA majority of patients treated in the UK have been registered with a database managed by the British Society for Rheumatology (BSRBR). We have, in unpublished data and indirect comparisons of randomised trials, found that there may be important differences in the drug continuation rates for different agents. There may be many explanations and confounding factors for this. Cost effectiveness models of TNF inhibitors show that the likelihood of prolonged use of a drug is a key factor in determining cost-effectiveness. \n\nHypothesis \nPatients taking adalimumab are not less likely to be using treatment than those taking etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis a year after starting therapy. Our intention is to show that adalimumab is not inferior to etanercept in terms of the proportion of patients still taking the drug after 1 year. This type of trial is called a \u0091non-inferiority trial\u0092. Unpublished data and preliminary evidence from indirect comparisons of clinical trials indicates that around 15% of fewer patients take adalimumab than etanercept a year after starting therapy. We believe that this level of difference is clinically important. It is also important on health economic grounds, as shown by our health economic analyses for NICE. \n\nInvolvement of research participants\nPatients have not been involved in planning this study but a copy of our protocol is being submitted to the rheumatology department patient user group at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham for feedback. Our project has been debated by all the consultant rheumatologists involved in the study.\n\nOutcomes & Definitions\nPrimary outcome\nThe proportions of patients still taking adalimumab and etanercept one year after starting treatment.\nPatients will be deemed to be still on treatment if an injection of adalimumab or etanercept has been used 12\nmonths after starting therapy, with a window of 2 weeks either side of the 12 month anniversary.\nStudy Population\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis attending the rheumatology outpatients departments of Selly Oak, City or\nSolihull Hospitals in Birmingham and St Mary\u0092s Hospital, Newport, Isle of Wight. Patients will be identified as\nthose likely to fulfill NICE criteria for receiving a TNF inhibitor and who are starting a TNF inhibitor for the first\ntime.\n\nInclusion Criteria\n1. Men and women over the age of 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis meeting international disease\nclassification criteria.\n2. NICE Criteria for treatment with TNF-inhibitors in regard to lack of response to at least two DMARDs (one\nof which must be methotrexate at adequate doses and for an appropriate length of time).\n3.

Any individual unable to understand study procedures or unwilling to comply.\n6. Previous treatment with any licensed or experimental biological TNF inhibitor.\n\nSchedule of Procedures - Overview\nEach patient will be monitored at 3 monthly intervals for one year or until they have ceased taking the drug during the study. Patients who have done well after 12 months and are still taking treatment and wish to continue may do so according to current practice. Visits will be arranged to suit patients and will be co-ordinated with routine clinical care. Suitability for TNF inhibitor therapy is usually evaluated by senior clinicians at clinic visits when a full medical evaluation is done. Once a patient meets eligibility criteria for TNF inhibitor therapy they will asked to consider being involved in the trial. Subsequent visits will take place at three, six and twelve months after starting treatment. More frequent visits may take place as determined by the judgement of the treating physician. No constraints will be placed on such visits. In addition there will be no restrictions on referrals to professionals allied to medicine, including physical therapy, additional DMARDs, corticosteroids given orally or parenterally, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and surgical treatment, if these are judged to be necessary by the clinicians caring for that patient. Patients who cease treatment between planned study visits will be assessed as soon as possible and final study data will be collected. \n\nScreening Visit & Baseline\n1. Consent signed in presence of Investigator (or sub-investigator).*\n2. Detailed medical and drug history.\n3. Chest X-Ray according to NICE guidance and as judged appropriate by consultant rheumatologist in\ncharge of the patient\u0092s care.\n4.

Confirmation of funding for therapy from the Primary Care Trust\n(*- study specific procedure)\n\nPatient will be notified of their allocated drug and funding approval will be confirmed with the Primary Care Trust according to current procedures. Once therapy has commenced an appointment will be arranged 12 to 16 weeks after initiation to evaluate response, or before if there are difficulties. Patients may have access to a local telephone help-line (supported by clinical nurse specialists in rheumatology). All patients will have access to their hospital consultant through their secretaries for advice about any aspects of their treatment and condition. All clinicians will have access to research staff by telephone (land lines and mobiles) and for advice about any aspect of the study.\n\nVisit at 12 to 16 weeks\n1.

This type of trial is called a \u0091non-inferiority trial\u0092. Unpublished data and preliminary analyses of randomised trials suggests that around 15% of fewer patients take adalimumab than etanercept a year after starting therapy. The proportion of patients still using a TNF inhibitor (data for all TNF inhibitors combined) a year after starting treatment is around 75%. We calculate that 124 patients (62in each treatment group) would be required to have an 80% chance of showing this with 95% confidence (one-sided analysis). These data correspond to an assumed scenario where the true proportion of patients taking adalimumab at 1 year would be 75% compared with 70% for etanercept. All patients receiving at least one dose of treatment will be included in the analysis. Patients who are randomised but do not receive any drug will be excluded from the analyses and the treatment allocation will be re-assigned to the next eligible patient. The proportions of patients remaining on adalimumab and etanercept will be compared using Fischer\u0092s exact test and survival analyses using the intention to treat principle. Interim analyses of the percentage of patients still taking their allocated drug 6 months after starting will be done after at least one half of the patients have been recruited. This will be done to review the sample size calculation and ensure that there are no overwhelming differences between treatments. Review by a formal data monitoring committee is not proposed but a consensus of participating colleagues will be sought if any concerns are identified.\n\nRandomisation\nPatients will be allocated etanercept or adalimumab randomly using a random number sequence generated by StatsDirect Statistical Software. Randomisation will be done according to whether it is planned for the patient to continue taking methotrexate with their allocated TNF inhibitor. This is standard practice and there is some evidence that this may be more effective than using a TNF inhibitor alone. However some patients are not keen to do this or have experienced adverse effects with methotrexate. A random sequence of numbers will be generated both for patients on methotrexate and for patients taking adalimumab or etanercept without methotrexate. Randomisation will be done in random block sizes. Opaque sealed envelopes of the allocation sequences will be prepared and managed at the co-ordinating centre (University Hospital Birmingham, Department of Rheumatology) by a member of staff not involved in patient management. A copy of the random sequences will be lodged, at the outset, with the R&D department of University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust NHS Foundation Trust to discourage tapering with the sequence of allocated treatments.\nImplications for the NHS There are no additional cost implications for the National Health Service. Only patients being put forward for TNF-inhibitor therapy will be approached for the study. A chest X-Ray and blood tests are required as part of routine management and are stipulated within NICE guidance for the use of these agents. Similarly follow up arrangements and monitoring are as stipulated in NICE guidance. Patients who cease treatment are normally reviewed as soon as possible and alternative treatment offered.\n\nAdverse events\nAdverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. All adverse events will be recorded whether or not they are considered to be related to the TNF-inhibitor therapy. Hospital records will be retrieved and reviewed for verification of adverse events, where necessary.\n\nSerious Adverse events\nData on serious adverse events (SAE) will be collected as part of the processes of clinical care and clinicians caring for patients will be asked to report serious SAEs as soon as they have been identified. A formal assessment of all adverse events will be made at scheduled study visits. SAEs are defined as:\n1. Fatal events\n2. Events judged to be life-threatening\n3. Events leading to hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation\n4. Events leading to persistent or significant disability/incapacity\n5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect during therapy\n6. Medically significant events or events that require intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above\n\nRisks & benefits for patients\nBoth adalimumab and etanercept appear to have similar side effects and both are licensed for the treatment of RA. Some are described below. The researchers will make every effort to ensure that risks are minimised and patients will be provided with contact details in case of emergency. Any complaints will be handled by current NHS procedures. All research done in UK hospitals is covered by insurance schemes. As far as we can tell there are no disadvantages or additional risks associated with participation in this study. Both drugs are believed to be amongst the most effective drugs for rheumatoid arthritis currently available. These drugs are available without taking part in this research. In any research study the researchers are obliged to take extra care often because of the need to do more measurements about a person\u0092s condition. People often do well because of this extra care but other than this there are no added benefits except for the potential benefits to future patients.\n\nPotential adverse effects\nInjection site reactions: The most common side-effect with these drugs is a reaction at the injection site. Redness, itching, bruising and discomfort at the site of injections is quite common. Most people can continue treatment despite these reactions which are usually of a minor nature. Other common side-effects: Common colds, chest infections and flu-like symptoms are reported commonly by people, including those who have tried adalimumab and etanercept. Similarly headaches, skin rashes, sinusitis, accidental injury, nausea, abdominal pain, back pain, urinary tract infection, and raised blood\npressure are commonly reported. Infection risk. Treatment with TNF inhibitors may make people more susceptible to infections and some may be severe. Those who currently have an infection and are on antibiotics should not start a TNF inhibitor. Care is also necessary in someone who is prone to repeated infections needing antibiotic treatment. If an infection develops whilst you are taking a TNF inhibitor you should seek medical advice early as it may be necessary to stop taking the TNF inhibitor. A risk of tuberculosis has been identified with these drugs. This is very uncommon but patients who have previously had tuberculosis need special care. Cardiovascular risk. There are rare reports of people with heart trouble suffering heart failure which is related to using a TNF inhibitor. If you suffer from heart disease you must discuss this with your doctor. Cancer risk. It is known that people with rheumatoid arthritis have a slightly increased risk of developing lymphoma, which is a type of blood and lymph gland cancer. This seems to be the case particularly in people with more joint inflammation. It is not known for certain whether TNF inhibitors increase the risk of these cancers. This is being investigated but so far there is no definite answer. It is possible that adalimumab and etanercept may slightly increase the risk of these cancers.\nNeurological risk. There have been rare cases of nerve damage in people taking these drugs. Symptoms in some cases have been similar to those of multiple sclerosis. It is not known for certain whether these symptoms were caused by a TNF inhibitor but this possibility has been considered.\nOther risks. Some other serious side-effects that have been seen include allergic reactions, abnormal laboratory blood tests including low levels of platelet cells which are responsible for clotting blood and of white and red blood cells.\n\nVaccinations. People using adalimumab or etanercept should not receive a \u0091live\u0092 vaccine whilst taking these drugs. The MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine and the BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis) are examples of live vaccines. Most vaccines given to adults are not \u0091live\u0092. \n\nUnknown risks. As with all drugs it is not possible to predict all adverse events. In the event of unexpected effects patients will be asked to communicate these to the research team. Telephone contacts will be provided.\n\nStudy Timetable\nIt is planned to start this study towards the end of 2006. It is believed that a pre-mixed syringe for etanercept will become available at this time. This will make the two preparations more comparable as, at present, patients (or their carers) are required to prepare a solution of etanercept before injecting. We believe that recruitment could take up to 18 months although with 4 centres this could be much shorter. Each treated patient need to be followed for 12 months. Thus this study is likely to take up to 3 years to complete, allowing for data analysis, interpretation and publication.\n\nSite of Interviews & Assessments\nAll procedures will be done at local rheumatology clinics. Key data will be forwarded to the co-ordinating centre as it is collected. Data will be stored on NHS computers and patients will be identified by code and local hospital number. Names and addresses will not be recorded. Researcher Bias\nSome clinicians may favor etanercept and others may favor adalimumab. These preferences may arise from their personal experiences or their interpretation of published results. Some centres may also prefer one drug over another. The larger participating centres have at least 3 consultant rheumatologists likely to contribute patients. Allocating treatments randomly according to each consultant is not practicable and even\nallocating treatments according to each centre poses problems because of the likelihood of fewer than 40 patients at each site. We believe that the different views of individual clinicians are such that in practice individual biases will not be problem and are unlikely to influence the data.\n\nStudy Data Management & Communicating Results to Patients\nInformation from each patient will be collected as the study proceeds and analysed. Data will be collected centrally at University Hospital Birmingham. Each patient will be allocated a code and identified only by their local hospital number. Details of the medical history and outcomes of treatment will recorded on NHS computers and will only be available to NHS staff and treated with the strictest confidence. At the end of the study centres will be asked to send a report of the study to their participants. This report will be prepared by the co-ordinating centre in a language that is understandable by lay people.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Adalimumab, Etanercept"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2012 Poster results in http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_3.toc#POSTERVIEWINGIIWEDNESDAY2MAY2012 results (no. 178 from poster session)", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "e9456c2e-52b2-4d31-956c-f25d0b04416f", "@outputType": "poster", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2012-05-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "false", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_3.toc#POSTERVIEWINGIIWEDNESDAY2MAY2012"}, "description": "results (no. 178 from poster session)", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder17109-0", "Funder17109-1"], "contactId": "Contact55070_17109", "sponsorId": "Sponsor53635"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55070_17109", "title": "Dr", "forename": "P", "surname": "Jobanputra", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Rheumatology\nSelly Oak Hospital", "city": "Birmingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B29 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor53635", "organisation": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UK)", "website": "http://www.uhb.nhs.uk/Homepage.aspx", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Research and Development\nNuffield House\nQueen Elizabeth Hospital\nEdgbaston", "city": "Birmingham", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B15 2TH", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.412563.7", "rorId": "https://ror.org/014ja3n03"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder17109-0", "name": "University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder17109-1", "name": "NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-08-17T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "23", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2007-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "58789949"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "A randomised controlled trial of a patient-held quality of life record in patients with inoperable lung and oesophageal cancer", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "To determine if patient held Quality of Life (QoL) tools improve the quality of care and patient quality of life.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary outcome is QoL, measured through two questionnaires:\n1.

OA of the knee and hip have the greatest impact on individuals, but OA in hand is also commonly affected. With an increasing proportion of older people in the population, OA assumes a growing public health problem.\n\nThe aims of this trial are:\n1. Patients with OsteoArthritis (OA) in hip, knee, hand and/or generalised OA who enter a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic, providing a brief group education intervention and individual consultations according to their needs, will be more satisfied with the health service and their health status than patients who receive individual consultation(s) in a traditional individual outpatient clinic.\n2. We expect no clinically significant difference in pain and disability between patients who enter a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic and patients who enter a traditional individual outpatient clinic.\n3. Patients with OA in hip, knee, hand and/or generalised OA who receive a telephone follow-up interview will be more satisfied with the health service and their health status than patients who receive follow-up 'as usual' (patients contact the clinic when necessary).  \n4. Patients with OA in hip, knee, hand and/or generalised OA who receive both the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic intervention and a telephone follow-up interview will have a significant effect on patient satisfaction, pain and disability when compared to patients who enter a traditional individual outpatient clinic with follow-up 'as usual'.\n5.

Consultation was held with lead neurologists in other regional centres.  The reason for comparing this treatment combination to high-dose Interferon Beta (Rebif 44) is that in most UK centres interferon would be considered 'standard or best' management of active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. There was no consideration of  using a placebo as not to treat this patient group would lead to sustained disability in the long term (and would be unethical).  The risks to the patients are minimised by proper safety tests (including echocardiograms, blood and urine tests) both before and during treatment. Also, the patients will not be excessively inconvenienced as we have tailored visits to be similar to what occurs in normal NHS practice.  \n\nTimetable:\n- February 2005 - January 2006: Recruitment of Patients\n- January 2006 - January 2009: Follow-up of patients with ongoing data collection.  \n- February 2009 - June 2009: Analysis and Presentation/Publication of Data.  \n\nThe interviews will take place at the Clinical Trials Unit at the Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery and similar units at the other participating regional trial centres.

Recently, a novel form of modified erythropoietin, darbopoetin alfa (Aranesp\u00ae), has been licensed for use. This has a longer duration of action and needs to be administered only once a week. Consequently, it does not result in a burst of erythropoietic activity. It is assumed that the prolonged erythropoiesis does not result in peaks of iron utilisation, and so requires lower levels of available iron, which can be replenished from iron stores sufficiently rapidly to continue to support erythropoiesis.
