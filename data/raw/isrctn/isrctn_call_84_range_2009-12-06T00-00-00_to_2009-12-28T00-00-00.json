Commercial kits were used (Vitrification and Warming KIT, Kitazato BioPharma Co, Japan). \n\nThe vitrification procedure was performed at room temperature (RT). Oocytes were equilibrated in the equilibration solution (ES) containing 7.5% ethylene glycol (EG) and 7.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in HEPES buffered basic culture medium M-199 with 20% synthetic serum substitute (SSS). To perform the equilibration gradually, the oocytes were first placed in a 20 microlitre drop of M199+20%SSS and, immediately, after mixed with a second 20 microlitre drop of ES. After 3 minutes incubation, a third 20 microlitre drop of ES solution was mixed. Finally, the oocyte were moved in a pure drop of 20 microlitre ES and incubated for an additional 6 - 9 minutes.

Finally, the plastic cap was pulled over the Cryotop inside the liquid nitrogen and the sample was stored submerged in liquid nitrogen. \n\nThe first step of warming procedure was performed at 37\u00b0C.

Surprisingly, there is a lack of well-conducted clinical trials; available studies have either been small and/or non-randomised. One reason could be that it has become popular to use devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandible retraction devices as mechanical tools rather than try to address the underlying problem, which generally is excess fatness in the throat area. In a report, from the International Diabetes Federation investigating the association between type 2 diabetes and sleep- disordered breathing, a number of recommendations were given. Apart from increased awareness and improved clinical practice the working party strongly suggested \"appropriately powered randomised control trials of weight loss in patients with OSAS and diabetes, including the use of anti-obesity medication\". The party also suggest the development of treatment programmes which are easier to use and cheaper than CPAP.

The study will test if there are genotype-dependent specific effects of the PPAR\u03b32 P12A polymorphism (P12P versus A12A homozygosity). Expression of genes relevant for inflammation and metabolic regulation will be examined in monocytes independent of a PPAR\u03b32 polymorphism. Further parameters to assess atherogenic processes are the expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM, E-Selectin). Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) will be isolated and tested for adhesion molecules expression on endothelial cells. As another study reported that a mixture of CLA isomers impairs endothelial function, this parameter will be determined in our study, with particular attention for the effect of individual isomers. As dietary fats may acutely change endothelial function, this parameter is tested both in the fasting state and following a fat-rich meal. Genotype-dependent specific effects on fat tissue are to be examined by determining the gene expression profile of the subcutaneous fat tissue.

It can be performed by midwives in health centres and needs only the drug and a syringe. Its efficacy has been tested in a number of randomised trials with varying results. A recent meta-analysis by the Cochrane collaboration suggests that it is of borderline efficacy. However, the previous trials have used a wide variety of oxytocin doses as well as a method of injection that has been shown to deliver little of the oxytocin to the placental bed. The results of a recent observational study suggests that with higher oxytocin doses delivered through a tube passed up the umbilical vein, high success rates can be obtained. The results of a pilot study of 10 women, suggests that a dose of 50 IU in 30 ml saline may be effective at delivering the placenta.\n\nA multi-centre randomised trial of this new method of umbilical vein injection is proposed. It will involve 572 women of over 34 weeks gestation with retained placenta of at least 30 minutes duration. The study centres will initially be Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Liverpool Women's Hospital, Liverpool and the Jessop Wing, Sheffield. The trial will be double-blind and women with retained placenta who are not bleeding excessively will be randomised to receive either oxytocin (50 IU in 30 ml saline) or placebo. Women will be eligible for inclusion from 30 minutes post-delivery and the primary outcome measure will be the incidence of manual removal of placenta. Women will go for immediate manual removal if haemorrhage occurs or at 30 minutes following the oxytocin injection. A study involving 572 women will have 80% power to detect a 20% reduction in the relative risk of manual removal with 95% significance.\n\nThe hypothesis is that intra-umbilical injection of oxytocin reduces the incidence of manual removal compared with placebo in the treatment of retained placenta.\n\nPlease note that as of 14/09/2007 the details of this trial were updated by the Principal Investigator (see contact details). Most changes are noted with the date 14/09/2007.

The two approaches being tested were:\n1. A questionnaire about health status completed by parents when the child reached a corrected age of 2 years\n2. A questionnaire completed by a clerk based in the local community child service when the child reached a corrected age of 2 years. The clerk used routine information collected about the child.\nBoth questionnaires were based on a consensus statement developed in the early 1990s about the measurement of health status at 2 years. Nine hospitals in two old NHS regions (Trent and Wessex) were randomly allocated to one of the two methods. Parents gave written consent for the inclusion of the child prior to discharge. For those in the 'parent arm' intermittent contact was maintained by using birthday and Christmas cards to prompt the family to inform the research team about changes of address.

No difference was found between the intervention and non-intervention groups in parent satisfaction scores. However, irrespective of intervention group, parents of children who received more information from their GP about glue ear had higher satisfaction scores than those that did not (p = 0.022).

Potential clinical partners for the second phase of the study will be systematically identified and recruited, during this stage using the survey analyses to provide clinical sites with co-incident day hospital and community rehabilitation services. Provided that the scoping analyses and pilot study confirm that the research question can be adequately addressed in the current NHS and sufficient appropriate clinical partners can be identified and recruited then the second phase, lasting 3 years, will begin. In the second phase a pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be carried out in which 680 patients will be randomised to receive either community based rehabilitation or day hospital based rehabilitation.\n\nProtocol can be found at http://www.hta.ac.uk/protocols/199700260001.pdf\nMore details can be found at http://www.hta.ac.uk/1218", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary outcome will be functional health status measured using the Nottingham extended ADL scale.
