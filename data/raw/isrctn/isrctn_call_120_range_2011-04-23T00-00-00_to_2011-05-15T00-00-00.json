The abduction strength of both shoulders of the 10 healthy volunteers will be measured three times with Isobex (in 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 Abduction), while superficial electromyography (EMG) documents the activity of the deltoid muscle. Subsequently, randomly and blinded, 5ml 1% Lidocain in one shoulder and 5ml 0.9% saline solution in the contralateral shoulder will be injected without ultrasonographic guidance aimed to the subacromial space. The injection will be performed blindly because the technique is commonly used in daily clinic and the evidence is not conclusive, although however, might by trend favour the use of ultrasonographic-guided injections. The technique of the injection is based on commonly used aseptic technique with a 21-gauge needle with the covered syringe, into the patient\u0092s subacromial bursa via the anterolateral approach.

Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently suggested that obese women gain between 5 and 9 kg during pregnancy. Almost 30% of pregnant women are overweight and 60% of them had a gestational weight gain (GWG) that did not meet IOM\u0092s recommendations. Weight gain during pregnancy over the recommended values exposes the mother and her infant to higher risks for perinatal adverse outcomes independently of the body mass index (BMI), such as diabetes or large for gestational age infants. Lifestyle interventions might improve nutritional habits and the practice of physical activity during pregnancy. Psychological interventions have to be targeted to elicit effective responses to intervention programs. Cerebral structures act as a network to influence feeding behaviour and appetite control. A hypnotherapy intervention was thus developed to enhance motivation and adherence to healthy lifestyle habits (i.e. healthy nutrition and physical activity) during pregnancy in obese pregnant women.\n\nHypnotherapy is a promising tool for inducing changes in attitudes and perceptions in the management of eating disorders.

On each occasion at 16:00, subjects consumed a light meal chosen from a list of standardised snacks (45 +/- 13 g carbohydrates) accompanied by prandial bolus calculated from subject's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. The subjects exercised at 55% VO2max on treadmill from 18:00 until 18:45 with a 5-minute rest at 18:20. Closed-loop was then performed overnight between 20:00 and 08:00.

The CARESS trial recently showed that aspirin and clopidogrel was better at preventing embolisation, detected using transcranial doppler ultrasound, than aspirin alone. Using a novel ambulatory transcranial doppler (TCD) system that allows us to perform prolonged recordings, we will determine whether clopidogrel or dipyridamole is better at preventing embolisation in patients with recent large artery stroke who are already taking aspirin.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the early risk of stroke after TIA or minor stroke is considerable and much higher than previously appreciated, being about 10% in the first week. A recent meta-analysis has shown much of this risk is accounted for by patients with large artery atherosclerotic disease. There is therefore a great opportunity to intervene early and prevent these recurrent strokes, particularly in large artery disease. Implementing such an approach will depend on both developing clinical services which allow patients to be identified very soon after the event and also developing better treatment approaches to prevent recurrent stroke after the patients present.\n\nFew studies have looked at optimal treatment regimes to prevent early recurrent stroke. One proven treatment strategy is early carotid endarterectomy. However, more effective medical treatments are also required for a number of reasons. Firstly much of the risk of stroke occurs within the first day or two after TIA or stroke; investigating and operating on patients within this time window is extremely difficult. Secondly in patients with lesser degrees of carotid stenosis endarterectomy is not indicated. Thirdly many patents with large artery disease are not amenable to endarterectomy (e.g. vertebral artery stenosis and intracranial disease). Therefore we need much more effective drug regimes to reduce this early recurrent stroke risk.  \n\nWe have very little information as to which anti-thrombotic regime is optimal in this group of patients. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the long-term risk of recurrent stroke; additionally the International Stroke Trial found that it reduced early recurrence by 0.7% in acute ischaemic stroke. Dual anti-platelet therapy with dipyridamole slow release and aspirin was shown to be more effective than aspirin alone in the long term secondary prevention of stroke in the ESPS 2 trial, a finding substantiated by our recent individual patient data meta-analysis of trials in patients with prior ischaemic stroke or TIA. In contrast, therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin was no more effective than clopidogrel alone in the long-term secondary prevention of stroke in the MATCH trial, although this interpretation has been challenged.\n\nHowever, these dual therapy trials have looked at long-term secondary prevention and the situation in the acute setting might be quite different. This is certainly the case in cardiology where different therapeutic regimes have been identified for the acute treatment of myocardial ischaemia, and its long term secondary prevention. The recent CARESS trial demonstrated that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone at reducing embolisation in patients with acutely symptomatic large vessel disease. This was the first multi-centre trial to use the surrogate endpoint of asymptomatic embolisation to evaluate anti-platelet therapy. Using transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) it is possible to detect asymptomatic emboli as they pass through the cerebral circulation, because they reflect and backscatter more ultrasound than surrounding red blood cells. Such embolic signals are markers of stroke risk in carotid artery stenosis; their presence independently predicts recurrent stroke and TIA risk in prospective studies, including a study of 200 patients from our unit. \n\nIn CARESS, the clopidogrel and aspirin combination led to a 37% reduction in the proportion of patients embolising. This was over a short time period of seven days, although treatment effects were present at 24 hours. There was also a highly significant reduction in the frequency of embolic signals per hour in the dual therapy group. Again this effect was present at 24 hours. Furthermore, although the trial was not powered to look at clinical events, there was a trend towards fewer recurrent events in the dual therapy group (0 strokes versus 4 strokes in the aspirin only group). Importantly if this technique is to be used as a surrogate endpoint, there was a highly significant relationship between recurrent events and embolic signals.\n\nThis data suggests that we should perhaps be using dual anti-platelet therapy in the acute setting in patients with stroke and TIA. This hypothesis will need to be tested in large clinical trials with the endpoint of recurrent stroke. However, before any clinical trials are performed in this area we need to know which is the optimal anti-platelet regime. The only dual antiplatelet regime currently recognised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is dipyridamole and aspirin, but we have no information about its efficacy in the acute setting. Therefore it is important that the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is compared with that of dipyridamole and aspirin. We plan to do this in a further study using Doppler embolic signal monitoring as a surrogate endpoint.\n\nOne problem with assessing the effects of dipyridamole is that its mechanisms of action as an antiplatelet agent are mediated as agonists of inhibitory systems, e.g. dipyridamole prevents red cell uptake of adenosine, an endogenous antiplatelet agent. Hence, conventional platelet function testing is not very sensitive to its effects. Thus, it is better to use a clinical surrogate endpoint such as embolic signals which will be more directly related to clinical efficacy. \n\nIn the CARESS study doppler embolic signal recordings were performed for one hour. We can now record using ambulatory TCD for eight hours. This allows much more information to be obtained on the rate of embolisation, markedly reducing inter-subject variability, and therefore treatment effects can be studied in smaller groups of patients.

Infact, macrovascular disease accounts for 70 % of the mortality in type 2 diabetes, making heart attacks and strokes two to four times more frequent in these patients compared to controls. The combination of diabetes and hypertension is a particularly strong cardiovascular risk factor. Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a recognised risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Blocking aldosterone with spironolactone in patients with cardiac failure can reverse endothelial dysfunction in this patient group, as well as improving the prognostic markers of PIIINP, BNP and heart rate variability. Additionally, the RALES (Randomised Aldactone Evaluation Study) and EPHESUS (Eplerenone Postacute myocardial infarction Heart failure Efficacy and Survival Study) studies have shown a dramatic reduction in total mortality (approximately 30%) with aldosterone blockade in patients with heart failure already taking the recognised optimum treatment for this condition. This lends weight to the concept that reducing endothelial dysfunction by spironolactone may be associated with reduction in real cardiovascular events. \n\nThe question then arose whether similar benefits might be seen in other diseases.  It was therefore somewhat surprising that in a normotensive population of patients with type 2 diabetes, spironolactone actually worsened the key prognostic marker of endothelial function while also worsening glycaemic control.  The situation might however be different in diabetics with poorly controlled hypertension where a spironolactone induced fall in BP might instead lead to an improvement in endothelial and autonomic function. We therefore studied whether, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and poorly controlled hypertension, taking low-dose spironolactone in addition to their normal cardiovascular medication, would improve the important prognostic marker of endothelial function, as logic suggests that this should be of benefit. In addition we wish to investigate whether spironolactone treatment also brings about an improvement in the other prognostic markers of PIIINP, BNP and heart rate variability. We also wanted to see if the spironolactone induced worsening of glycaemic control that we saw in a previous study in normotensive diabetics was reproducible.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Improvement in endothelial function, assessed 24 months after the start of the trial.", "secondaryOutcome": "The following were assessed 24 months after the start of the trial: \n1.

The course will be led by a clinical psychologist, supported by a nurse, physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist  and psychology research associate. \n\nThree to four facilitators will attend all sessions to ensure quality CBT and team working, to allow one-to-one goal setting and to ensure patients can receive adequate individual support if issues are discussed that have particular personal implications for them (e.g., effect of fatigue on relationships). Sessions will be supported with handouts, and some work at home in between the weekly sessions is a necessary part of the course, e.g., diary keeping and achieving goals.  \n\nThe first session will establish:\n1. The group\u0092s ground rules (e.g., commitment and confidentiality)\n2. The purpose and expectations of the course (e.g., management not cure)\n3. Defining fatigue and its consequences\n4. Differentiating between disease activity flares, pain, stiffness and fatigue\n\nGoal-setting will be introduced in the second session and will form a feature of every session. \n\nSessions two to six will cover: \n1. Energy management (planning, pacing and prioritising activities)\n2. Activity cycling\n3. Assertiveness\n4. Recuperation or restoration of energy\n5. Sleep\n6. Negative self-talk\n7. Graded activity\n8. Passivity\n9. Reconditioning and increasing physical activity\n10. Links between fatigue, pain, stress, and depression\n11. Relaxation\n12. Management of stress\n13. Avoiding and resolving setbacks\n\nUsing the theoretical concepts of CBT, enhancing self-efficacy and achieving behaviour change, the course will use delivery methods such as role modelling, group work, addressing barriers, and positive reinforcements (e.g., using a pedometer as a visual aid to increase activity). Patients will be asked to keep a diary of events in order to help them manage their fatigue more effectively. Individually tailored goal-setting and contracting will be used to set individual, realistic goals, which are the means of transferring gains in managing the RA symptoms, into improved quality of life. The aim is that participants will achieve improved functioning in their domestic role and social life, which should in turn raise confidence and reduce emotional distress, including depression.  \n\nThe information-only arm will involve a single, one-hour group session of seven to ten participants, led by a rheumatology nurse (DP).  It will use a largely information-giving approach, based on the two arc leaflets, allowing participants to share and discuss their current experiences and coping mechanisms. The clinical psychologist (NA) will provide support for the researcher before she delivers the control arm sessions (DP), to ensure a CBT approach is not utilised. The approach taken in the control arm will be to provide information and support the current coping strategies the participants already use, as it is not known whether or not a CBT approach is beneficial.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21540202 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "13e3cecf-b235-4495-a16f-fa58087ab4eb", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21540202"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder15814-0", "contactId": "Contact53754_15814", "sponsorId": "Sponsor52307"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact53754_15814", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Sarah", "surname": "Hewlett", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Academic Rheumatology\nBristol Royal Infirmary", "city": "Bristol", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "BS2 8HW", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)117 928 2903"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "Sarah.Hewlett@uwe.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor52307", "organisation": "University of the West of England (UK)", "website": "http://www.uwe.ac.uk/", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "c/o Professor Robin Means\nAssociate Dean\nFaculty of Health and Social Care\nGlenside Campus\nBlackberry Hill", "city": "Bristol", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "BS16 1DD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "Robin.Means@uwe.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.6518.a", "rorId": "https://ror.org/02nwg5t34"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder15814-0", "name": "Arthritis Research Campaign (UK) (grant)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "25", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2007-01-26T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "03090939"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "A comparison of high cocoa solid with absent cocoa solid chocolate in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in a double blind randomised controlled trial", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "High polyphenol chocolate improves symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Improvement of fatigue using Chandler Fatigue scale, London Handicap Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.", "secondaryOutcome": "Change in weight", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Hull and East Riding Research Ethics committee on 06/10/2003 (ref: LREC/07/03/121)"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN03090939", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "ELSY No 2870"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Double blind randomised trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2005-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2006-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "38da4536-6482-455b-8cc7-9b627c3f0a6f", "name": "Micheal White Diabetes Centre", "address": null, "city": "Hull", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "HU3 2RZ"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.
