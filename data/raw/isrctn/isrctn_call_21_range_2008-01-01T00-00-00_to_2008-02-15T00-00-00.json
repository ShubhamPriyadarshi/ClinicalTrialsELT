Most consistently, an increased risk for attention problems, hyperactivity and social or peer relationship problems have been reported across a range of hospital and geographically defined cohorts. Improvements in infant self-regulation and mother-infant-relationship may avert longterm behavioural and social relationship sequelae of very preterm birth. A first step in demonstrating such a link is to test in a randomised controlled trial whether an individualised family based approach can alter infant social-emotional regulation. \n\nHypothesis: Does an individualised family-based early support intervention (case management approach) for mothers of prematurely born infants alter 1) the maternal sensitivity and 2) infant social-emotional regulation and reciprocal quality of mother-infant interaction in the first 6 months of life?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary outcome measure was the improvement in social-interactive behaviour of the infants, mother's sensitivity and the dyadic quality of interaction. Before discharge the nurses assessed the early mother sensitivity with the Boston City Hospital Assessment of Parental Sensitivity (BCHAPS)(Timepoint 1). This questionnaire consists of 13 closed-ended items, evaluating the mother's sensitive responsivness and care giving competence. The items are ranked on 5-point scales from \"poor\" to \"competent\" and the scores totalled. \n\nAt 6 months corrected age the infant social-interactive behaviour and mother-infant interaction were assessed with the Mother-Infant Structured Play Assessment (MISPA)(Timepoint 2). This is an 8-minute, semi-structured face-to-face play interaction which includes the Still-Face Paradigm, which provides a method to access infant regulatory capacities and illustrates central qualities of the young infant's capacities for interpersonal engagement. For the interaction records the infants were placed on a blanket or mat on the floor and mothers were asked to sit on the floor opposite their infant. A mirror was mounted at an angle, which enabled the examiner to videotape both the face and body of the infant and the face and upper torso of the mother. Standardised instructions were used to explain the procedure to the mothers. \n\nEpisode 1 involved the mother playing with her baby with a rattle (warm-up). After 2 minutes (Episode 2) she was cued to lay aside the rattle and play (without a toy) with her baby for another 2 minutes. Then she was asked to get her baby to watch her face, which lasted for 1 minute (Episode 3). Next she was asked to make a still-face for 1.5 minutes (Episode 4) and then finally asked to resume playing with her baby for another 1.5 minutes (Episode 5). \n\nThree existing schemes were modified and adapted to create a suitable coding scheme: \n1. The Play Observation Scheme and Emotion Ratings (POSER)\n2. The Emotional Availability Scales (EAS)\n3. Tronick and Weinberg's Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phases (ICEP)\n\nEach interaction episode was coded with 5-point scales reflecting maternal sensitivity (apart from episode 4) and infant social regulatory behaviour. Maternal Sensitivity consisted of 5 rating scales (sensitivity, positive response, negative facial emotional expression, verbal involvement, undercontrol) that were totalled to gain a measure of maternal sensitivity. Social Regulatory Behaviour was also assessed using 5 rating scales (emotional state, attentiveness, responsivness, vocalisation, clarity of signals). \n\nQuality of dyadic interaction consisted of 2 five-point rating scales (Harmony, Control over interaction) and the scores were totalled. Each of the five episodes in the MISPA was scored separately, and infant, maternal and dyadic behaviours were coded individually. The last episode demonstrating mother-infant reunion after perturbation of interaction was decided to be confirmative for the effect of the intervention. This episode presents the infant with a complex and demanding regulatory task: the infant needs to simultaneously cope with the resumption of the maternal behaviour, as well as the carry-over of negative affect from the still-face episode.", "secondaryOutcome": "The demographic characters and the medical and psychosocial burden of the families were recorded with a structured mother-interview at both time points.

Two established surgical techniques are compared: \n1. Total mesorectal excision (TME), to completely eliminate affected and surrounding tissue, bears the risk of post-surgical complications\n2. Partial mesorectal excision (PME) restricts surgery to the afflicted tissue and defined surroundings\n\nPME may be equally effective in eliminating cancer while limiting post-operative complications. No clinical data have been raised to date that show if TME or PME is oncologically superior. To answer this requires a refocus on the principles of both resection techniques, including peri- and post-operative quality control. Post-surgical chemotherapy is identical in both trial arms. Primary endpoint is the disease-free survival after 3 years. \n\nThe GAST-05 study is an add-on study to the ongoing CAO/AIO/ARO-04 trial, which intends to optimise the pre-surgical chemoradiotherapy of cUICC stage II/III cancers in the lower two thirds of the rectum (0 - 12 cm). The comparison of the long-term outcomes of both studies (GAST-05: surgical procecures; CAO/AIO/ARO-04: intensified preoperative treatment) will influence future studies; they will apply the surgical procedure that is identified as being superior during the GAST-05 study. Additional gene expression analyses on pre-therapeutically taken tumour probes will show if gene profiling can help to predict individual prognosis. \n\nThe identification of the oncologically superior of two standardised surgical treatments (TME and PME) of cUICC stage II/III cancers of the upper third of the rectum has not been determined. The identification is a prerequisite for further studies, needed to reduce the side effects of optimised surgical treatments. If both techniques, TME and PME, turn out to be equivalent, that technique will be regarded as superior, which promises less comorbidities, a higher qualitiy of life, and lower health care costs (i.e. PME). \n\nA cross-comparison of disease-free and overall survival data from the GAST-05 trial and the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial will further allow judgement on the need for further studies on multimodal therapies for rectal cancers of the upper third. If the rate of local and distant metastases turns out to be equal or lower in the GAST-05 trial (upper third, no neoadjuvant RT/CT, PME/TME) than in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04-trial (lower two thirds, intensified preoperative treatment), further trials may be unnecessary which test multimodal therapies in cancers of the upper third.

Cerclage group \n2. Amniocentesis and cerclage group\n\nRandomisation will be organised by a random numbers table and assigned by telephone. Women randomised to the amniocentesis group will undergo an aseptic aspiration of amniotic fluid under ultrasound guidance by a single operator. Briefly, the abdomen will be prepared with antiseptic solution and draped with sterile towels. The ultrasound transducer probe will be draped with a sterile plastic cover. Using a sterile water-based ultrasound gel to facilitate visualisation, the operator will identify a pocket of amniotic fluid suitably away from the foetus and placenta. A sterile 22 gauge needle will be passed into the uterine cavity under direct visualisation and approximately 15 cc of amniotic fluid will be aspirated. \n\nPost procedure, Rhogam\u2122 will be administered to Rhesus negative patients as indicated. Amniotic fluid will be tested for lactate dehydrogenase level (2 cc), glucose level (2 cc), cell count (2 cc), haemoglobin level (2 cc) and Gram staining (2 cc). Amniotic fluid will be sent for confirmatory aerobic, anaerobic and myoplasma/ureaplasma culture (4 cc per culture). \n\nAll tests will be performed by the respective Departments of Biochemistry, Haematology and Microbiology (Mount Sinai Hospital, Canada) using established protocols. While waiting for the fluid test results (approximately 90 - 120 minutes), a tocodynometer will be placed over the uterine fundus to confirm the absence of uterine activity. Those women without evidence of subclinical infection following amniocentesis and those women who were randomised to the cerclage group will have a rescue cerclage placed. \n\nRescue cerclage placement will be performed under general anaesthesia. Women will be placed in the lithotomy position with a steep Trendelenberg tilt. The prolapsed membranes will be gently pushed back into the uterine cavity with an inflated Foley catheter. A single purse string suture (#5 Ticron\u2122) will be performed using the technique described by MacDonald. Perioperative tocolysis (indomethacin 100 mg per rectum [pr] followed by 25 mg orally every 6 hours for 48 hours) to prevent the uterine contractions that can be precipitated by cervical manipulation and cerclage insertion and prophylactic antibiotics (clindamycin 900 mg intravenous [iv] three times a day [TID] for 7 days) will be administered.

Patients taking excluded medications (see exclusion criteria below) may enter the study after a two week period without these medications\n\nDiagnosis of neuropathic pain:\nThe term \"neuropathic pain\" is loosely applied to a variety of heterogeneous conditions and strict diagnostic criteria are difficult to apply. However, for the purposes of this study, the diagnosis will be made on the basis of the following:\n1. Pain secondary to an identifiable injury or disease process where damage to the central or peripheral nervous system is suspected\n2. Pain persisting for more than three months in the absence of any continuing nociceptive stimulus\n3. Pain that is documented as responding poorly to either opioid analgesics or NSAIDs\n4. Pain associated with at least two of the following signs/symptoms:\n4.1. Abnormal sensation on clinical examination, including sensory loss, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia\n4.2. Mechanical allodynia (static or dynamic)\n4.3. Pain of a burning character\n4.4. Pain of a stabbing or lancinating character\n4.5. Signs of sympathetic dysfunction (discolouration, abnormal vasomotor activity, skin trophic changes)\n\nMany conditions may present with neuropathic pain. However, in some conditions the\ndistinction between primary nociceptive and neuropathic pain is extremely difficult. An\nimportant example of this is in mechanical low back pain where radiation of pain into the legs is commonly reported in the absence of identifiable nerve injury. Given this diagnostic difficulty, for the purpose of this study, patients with lumbar radiculopathy will not be recruited to the study.\n\nThe Central Post-Stroke Pain Syndrome seems to have features that are significantly different to other types of neuropathic pain.

The family planning nurse will be available to provide attention to the patient during those 20 minutes. Then the patient will enter the operating room with the nurse and lie supine on a gynecological table. As the abortion will be performed by the physician, the family planning nurse will provide attention and support to the patient, talking and listening to her, giving positive encouragement, reassurance, instructions for relaxation (abdominal and pelvic area) and deep breathing. There will be no instructions for imagery and no suggestions directed at decreasing pain or anxiety.  \n\nHypnosis group: \nA medical doctor will complete 30 hours of training in hypnosis prior to conducting the study (Introductory Sessions, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise d\u0092Hypnose). This training will focus on the basic skills of induction, hypnosis theory, and the integration of hypnosis into clinical practice. Demonstrations and opportunities for practice will be provided to enable participants to begin utilizing hypnosis in their clinical practice. The specific script used in this study will be developed with the collaboration of the co-investigators and psychologists in charge of the training. Practice will then be centered on the needs of the current project and the written script will be tested on five female volunteers for acceptability. \n\nPre-surgical hypnotic intervention: \nAfter randomization, and for the 20 minutes leading up to the procedure, patients in the hypnosis group will sit in a comfortable chair in a different room from the waiting area, where they will meet with the hypnosis provider. First, misconceptions about hypnosis will be cleared up to facilitate a positive attitude. The practitioner will then induce hypnosis by reading from a script prepared for this purpose. Physical and mental relaxation will be initiated by a suggestion of deep breathing, fixation on a part of the hand, and a sensation of floating or heaviness. Several analgesic strategies will then be tried with suggestions generally phrased to facilitate dissociation (e.g. 'the hand' instead of 'your hand'). Focal anesthesia suggestions inducing numbness of the hand (glove anesthesia) will be given to the patient with additional suggestions to transfer the numbness to the abdominal area by placing the hand on the abdomen. Suggestions for imagery will be introduced, including feelings of a warm or a cold wave of light spreading in the body, and relaxation in a safe and pleasant place that they particularly like. Direct suggestions to decrease pain intensity (like a rheostat) and unpleasantness (feeling more comfortable) during the surgical procedure will also be introduced. The patient will also be told that she is able to ask for anything that would increase her comfort during the surgical procedure. The total duration of the pre-surgical hypnotic induction was 20 minutes. \n\nSurgical hypnotic intervention: \nThe patient will then be asked to walk to the surgery room with the hypnotist. The patient will be told that if she 'comes out' of hypnosis, she will be able to get back into this state once in the surgery room. Once she will be positioned supine on the surgical table, the hypnotist practitioner will suggest that she goes back deeper into hypnosis. Hypnosis will continue throughout the procedure to buffer response to painful stimuli using the same suggestions of well-being and imagery, and emphasizing decreased intensity and unpleasantness of pain using the preferred analgesic strategies that were introduced during the pre-surgical induction. The patient will be told again that she can ask for anything that would increase her comfort at any time during the procedure. At the end of the surgical procedure (removal of the speculum), the patient will receive suggestions to end hypnosis and become alert.\n\nSurgical procedure: \nThe surgical procedure will be similar to the ones outlined in the clinical policy guidelines and the paper by Burnhill. In the operating room, the standard procedure will begin by a brief preoperative discussion with the physician performing the abortion. The procedure will be performed by one of four physicians involved in this study. The patient will then lie back on the gynecological table. After a manual pelvic examination, the surgeon will insert a sterile vaginal speculum (Step 1) and will then inject 1 to 2 cc of  0.5% lidocaine at 12 o\u0092clock on the cervix and an additional 5 cc each at 4 and 8 o\u0092clock at 1 to 2 cm-deep for a total volume of 12 cc of lidocaine. Dilators will be used to dilate the cervix sufficiently (Step 2, maximal dilatation) to admit a rigid vacuum cannula of 8 to 12 mm depending of the gestational age (typically a 9 mm cannula is used for a 9 week gestational age). The uterine contents will be evacuated with suction (Step 3) with a uterine aspirator at maximum vacuum. Suction will follow by a sharp curetage (Step 4) to confirm that the uterus was empty. If necessary, a re-aspiration of the uterine contents will be performed. The patient will recover for a few minutes on the table and will then walk to the recovery room. Most of the patients will be discharged within 1-2 hours after the end of the procedure. \n\nAt each step of the procedure, women usually experience pain, the most painful step being the suction of the uterine contents (Step 3). Cervical dilatation is also a painful and difficult part of surgical evacuation, and cervical priming may have a very important effect on the amount of pain that the patient experiences. Furthermore, women often experience pain before the surgical procedure. To help with cervical dilatation, laminaria tents will be used, 4 to 20 hours before the abortion. Indications for the use of laminaria tents will include women whose pregnancies were greater than or equal to 9 weeks, stenosis and surgical history of the cervix, age less than 20, gravida greater than or equal to 5. \n\nDuring the surgical procedure, patients will be monitored continuously by pulse oxymetry for oxygen desaturation and for changes in blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nInitial assessment on arrival: \nSelf reported anxiety and pain. Patient self-reported anxiety and pain will be assessed before randomization. In both the hypnosis group and the control group, the practitioner will ask the patient to rate her anxiety and pain on an 11-point verbal numerical scale. Anxiety levels will be assessed on scales from 0 to 10 (0 = not anxious at all; 10 = the most anxious that you can be). Intensity of pain will be rated on separate scale from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain at all; 10 = the most intense pain possible). These verbal scales have been validated for pain and anxiety.\n\nOther measurements: Furthermore, before randomization, expected pain intensity will be assessed. The Pain Catastrophizing Scales (PCS) will be used to assess emotions previously shown to affect pain. A questionnaire assesses the belief in hypnosis in the two groups before randomisation. \n\nDuring the surgical procedure: \nAssessment of medication requirement. Intravenous sedation during abortion will be assessed as a dichotomous variable (requested or not requested by the patient) at any step of the surgical procedure: insertion of speculum, maximum dilation, suction, and end of curettage abortion. Irrespective of her group, each patient will be allowed to receive sedation as she wants and whenever she wants during the procedure. \nAssessment of pain and anxiety. Patient self-reported anxiety and pain (intensity and unpleasantness) will be assessed using the same 11-point verbal scales described above at each of the 3rd step of the procedure (aspiration). \n\nDuring recovery: \nOnce again, patient self-reported anxiety and intensity of pain and relief will be assessed using the same scales described above. Additional questionnaires will be administered to obtain demographic information (maternal age, gestational age, parity, previous history of abortion). The physician who will perform the abortion will also complete a questionnaire describing oral medication administered before or after the abortion and the pre-surgical use of a laminaria tent to facilitate cervical dilation. His appreciation of the overall success of the procedure will be assessed with a short series of questions regarding surgical difficulties on a ten-point scales (ranging from the worse to the best). The duration of the procedure will be calculated from the total time spent by the women in the surgical room.\n\nTrial details received: 12 Sept 2005", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder13789-0", "contactId": "Contact51481_13789", "sponsorId": "Sponsor49885"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51481_13789", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Sylvie", "surname": "Dodin", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "H\u00f4pital Saint-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise-CHUQ\nCentre de recherche\n10, rue de l'Espinay\nLocal D6-702", "city": "Qu\u00e9bec", "country": "Canada", "zip": "G1L 3L5", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+1 418 525 4348"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "sylvie.dodin@ogy.ulaval.ca"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor49885", "organisation": "University Laval, Manon Guillemette (Canada)", "website": null, "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Coordonnatrice des op\u00e9rations financi\u00e8res\nService des finances\nPavillon Jean-Charles-Bonenfant\nLocal 3413", "city": "Qu\u00e9bec", "country": "Canada", "zip": "G1K 7P4", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+1 418 656 2131 poste 6513"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "Manon.Guillemette@sf.ulaval.ca"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.23856.3a", "rorId": "https://ror.org/04sjchr03"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder13789-0", "name": "Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (Canada) - http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca (ref: MCT-68538)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2008-02-14T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "20", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2005-09-12T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "46249783"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "MEMO study: Mental health in Elderly Maintained with Omega-3", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "MEMO", "studyHypothesis": "Counteract the process of mental deterioration in elderly people through enhancement of their EPA-DHA status", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Cognitive function and mental well-being", "secondaryOutcome": "Quality of life", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN46249783", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "2005_05/08"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2005-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2007-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Netherlands"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "7462927a-c5f8-4d6d-acd0-a8f68ccd6d26", "name": "Division of Human Nutrition", "address": null, "city": "Wageningen", "state": null, "country": "Netherlands", "zip": "6700 EV"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.

The scientific literature about the reasons for non-compliance have generated few definitive operational recommendations. \n\nTwo types of FOBT are now available: the Guaiac and the Immunochemical test. The sensitivity and specificity of the two tests are similar and do not clearly indicate which one is better for screening. The price of the immunochemical test is actually about 1.5 times higher than the Guaiac, but there are no data about the costs per person screened. The Guaiac test recommends three different evacuations, and requires the patient to store the samples, and follow dietary restrictions. The immunochemical test is recommended on a single evacuation and does not require dietary restrictions. The discomfort and embarrassment of faecal sampling and the dietary restrictions have been hypothesized to be determinants of non-compliance. This background may determine lower compliance to the Guaiac test.\n \nSeveral guidelines for screening programme implementation recommend the involvement of general practitioners (GP) and family practitioners (FP); nevertheless the role of the GPs and FPs varies between countries and health service organizations, making this recommendation hard to implement. The Agency for Public Health of Lazio, Italy, decided to design a trial phase in order to plan an evidence-based implementation of the CRCS program. The aim of this approach is to guarantee that the efficacy of CRCS can be translated to effectiveness in a public health intervention. The screening strategy adopted was: yearly FOB testing for 50\u009674 year olds and, for positives, colonoscopy. A special focus was how to obtain a high compliance to screening; the topics studied were: GPs\u0092 attitudes and practices, type of FOBT, test provider, and the individual reasons. \n\nStudies included: a survey, a randomized factorial trial nested in the survey, and a case\u0096control study nested in the trial.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Compliance to screening: (number of returned faeces samples)/(total number of invited subjects)", "secondaryOutcome": "Positivity rate; variability of the positivity rate; rate of inadequate samples; positive predictive value.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN83029072", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N/A"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Screening"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2002-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2003-04-30T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Italy"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "b8dfcea6-2a7a-49ba-a6ad-9d8276eb7584", "name": "Agency for Public Health, Lazio Region", "address": null, "city": "Rome", "state": null, "country": "Italy", "zip": "00198"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "We selected 13 hospitals, out of 20 to participate in the screening programme, in order to represent all types of gastroenterology units (5 university hospitals, 2 large research hospitals, 6 local hospitals) and all geographic areas (7 in the metropolitan area of Rome, 2 in the outskirts of Rome, 4 in towns and small cities of the province).
