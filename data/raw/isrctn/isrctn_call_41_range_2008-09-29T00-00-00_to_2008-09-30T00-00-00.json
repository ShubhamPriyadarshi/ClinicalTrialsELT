Fluid preload for epidural analgesia initiation ranges from 500 cc to 1000 cc of Ringers Lactate and intravenous (IV) fluid is administered throughout labour for non-reassuring foetal heart rate tracings and maternal fever. Hourly infusion volumes vary from 125 to 250 ml per hour or greater. Calculations of fluid balance may not be routinely conducted intrapartum but summarised at the time of transfer of the woman to the postpartum floor. Intrapartum assessments do not routinely include hydration assessments or calculation of intrapartum fluid balance.\n\nConservative Fluid Management:\nA conservative intrapartum fluid management protocol will be administered to the experimental group. This protocol assumes that care is individualised to the labouring woman and will be reflective of the events of her labour. Women will receive an epidural analgesia preload of 250 to 500 ml of Ringers Lactate and the intravenous infusion will continue at the hourly rate of 75 to 100 ml per hour. Hydration assessments and fluid balance calculations will be conducted and recorded every four hours.
