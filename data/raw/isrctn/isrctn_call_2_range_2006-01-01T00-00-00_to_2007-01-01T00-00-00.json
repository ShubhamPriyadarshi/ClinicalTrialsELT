Another characteristic of FM is tenderness at palpation in defined points at the neck and lower back areas. \n\nTianeptine is an antidepressant agent with a novel neurochemical profile. It increases serotonin (5-HydroxyTryptamine [5-HT]) uptake in the brain (in contrast with most antidepressant agents), promotes neuroplasticity and reduces stress-induced atrophy of neuronal dendrites.

The finding that pretreatment with reserpine, which induces a depletion of catecholamines, abolishes the effect of Tyramine on blood pressure suggests that Tyramine acts indirectly as a sympathomimetic agent. It has been shown that Tyramine is taken up in NE neurons by the NE transporter and that by stochiometric displacement, it then releases NE from intraneuronal stores (Hoffman and Lefkowitz 1990). Blood pressure is increased by the release of NE; therefore, blood pressure serves as a simple and reliable index of the action of Tyramine. The Tyramine test (Ghose and Turner 1975) consists of measuring the transient increase in the blood pressure of patients after a Tyramine load. It can be carried out either by determining the dose of Tyramine required to induce a fixed increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (for example, 30 mmHg,) or by measuring the effect of a fixed dose of Tyramine. Pretreatment with Tomoxetine (now called Atomoxetine), a relatively potent and selective inhibitor of NE uptake, has been reported to decrease the transient elevation in blood pressure produced by Tyramine administration (Zerbe et al. 1985). In recent work, we have demonstrated that transient blood pressure elevation in response to Tyramine is reduced by pretreating subjects with Desipramine, Nortriptyline, Clomipramine and Reboxetine, three NE uptake inhibitors, but not by pretreating with Paroxetine, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor (Blier et al. 1997; Slater et al. 2000; Turcotte et al. 2001). In the proposed study, if treated subjects decrease their pressor response to Tyramine, it will be interpreted as evidence of NE uptake inhibition.\nIn this study, the 5-HT content of the whole blood will be used as an index of 5-HT uptake in depressed patients and will be measured before and after each week of treatment. Since more than 90% of the 5-HT in the blood is in platelets, it is not necessary to correct this value for the platelet count. Notably, Flament et al. (1987) found that the mean level of 5-HT did not change significantly after 5 weeks of placebo whereas it dropped by 95% after 5 weeks of treatment with clomipramine. In this study, the use of each subject as his own control will allow the use of covariance analysis, increasing the likelihood of detecting a statistically significant difference between the different groups at the end of the treatments.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary objective of this study is to find evidence of a dose-dependent inhibition of NE reuptake starting of Venlafaxine at 150 mg/day.", "secondaryOutcome": "A secondary objective of this study is to show a lack of effect of Paroxetine on NE reuptake at doses of up to 50 mg/day.
