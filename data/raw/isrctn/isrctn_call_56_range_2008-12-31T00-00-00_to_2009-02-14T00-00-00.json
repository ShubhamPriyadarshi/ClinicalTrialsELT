At present, World Health Organization (WHO) led control activities in Africa mainly rely on mass administration of microfilaricidal drugs, with a measure of success. However, it has become clear that new, complementary therapies, ideally being macrofilaricidal, must be developed for sustainable control. \n\nIn lymphatic filariasis (LF), there is the additional need to deliver new therapies for lymphatic pathology, i.e. lymphoedema and urogenital pathology such as hydrocele and lymphocele, which are not targeted by current mass drug administrations. Depletion of Wolbachia essential endosymbionts of filariae with doxycycline, an approach established by our group, resulted in macrofilaricidal activity in LF. The present study hypothesises that Wolbachia also play a major role in inducing and maintaining lymphatic pathology, and that doxycycline may therefore improve hydrocele. \n\nThe aim of this project is:\n1. To analyse to what extent hydrocele is caused by Wolbachia. To this, the Wolbachia-depleting antibiotic doxycycline will be administered and alterations of hydrocele size will be determined.\n2.

In glaucoma patients high levels of different markers of oxidative stress have been found. With regard to anti-oxidant defenses, low levels of glutathione in serum and aqueous humor and a decreased total reactive anti-oxidant potential in aqueous humor have been evidenced in glaucoma patients. Some publications suggest that antioxidants are important in maintaining cellular homeostasis relevant to the etiology of POAG. More studies are needed for a further precision of the real importance of nutritional factors in glaucoma.\n\nA nutritional formula combining different antioxidants (alpha lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, bilberry extract) and vitamins B1, B12 is proposed to be tested in glaucoma patients. In this study two hypothesis has been tested:\nHypothesis 1: That a 6 month treatment with the antioxidant formulation at a dosage of 1 tablet (containing alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, bilberry extract, vitamin B1 and B12) twice a day versus placebo significantly increases the level of total antioxidant status in serum.\nHypothesis 2: That 6 month treatment with antioxidant formulation at dosage of 1 tablet twice a day versus placebo significantly reduces the level of oxidative stress marker (isoprostanes) in urine in patients with POAG.\n\nIn both cases the null hypothesis, expected to be rejected, is that there is no difference between the antioxidant formulation and placebo.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Efficacy variables: \n1.

Consequently, the impact of the cryopreservation program on the in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) success rate is augmented since more surplus embryos become available. SET requires a cryopreservation program which optimally preserves the vitality of the surplus embryos. The first step to improve the efficiency of a cryopreservation program is to improve the post-thaw embryo survival. Retrospective analysis of our slow-cooling and thawing cryopreservation program showed that about 35% of day 3 cleavage stage embryos are severely damaged after freezing and thawing and are not suitable for transfer and another 15% is moderately damaged. \n\nAccording to recent findings, vitrification as a new cryopreservation method is assumed to reduce cryo-damage and thus better preserves the embryo viability. During vitrification the formation of intracellular ice formation is prevented by short incubation of the embryos in high concentrations of cryoprotective agents. Successful vitrification of embryos at all preimplantation stages has been reported. Retrospective analyses show higher or similar survival and implantation rates after vitrification compared to the results obtained after traditional slow freezing and thawing. However, these data remain unvalidated in prospectively randomised studies.\n\nThe aim of the study is to compare the live birth rate after transfer of one frozen-thawed day 3 embryo using either vitrification or slow freezing as the cryopreservation method.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Live birth rate per frozen-thawed embryo", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

Other tumour antigens (e.g. NY-ESO 1) have been studied in similar studies, where single patients responded to the vaccination and achieved regression of the tumour manifestations.

Identify physiological and morphological basis for improvements in symptoms and quadriceps strength as a dose-response relationship to NMES. Increasing muscle strength should be preceded with up-regulation of target genes resulting in larger muscle volume. This can be quantified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to calculate muscle cross-sectional area. At the molecular level, detect gene down-regulation of muscle atrophy pathways such as MuRF-1 and MARbx and up-regulation of IGF-1.\n3.

We will ensure each subject is competent with garment application, stimulator controls, and completion of the log-diary before commencing training. They will also receive clear, written instruction on the device controls and the NMES training program schedule. All NMES sessions will be performed with the subject sitting with their knee flexed to 60 degrees. Wooden strips joined with a 60 degrees bend will be provided to all subjects to assist with positioning throughout the program. They will sit with their feet flat on the ground and their toes against a wall to prevent knee extension caused by the resulting quadriceps contractions and thus permit isometric training.\n\nSubjects will then commence five sessions per week (Monday to Friday) for 6 weeks. Training sessions will last 20 minutes in duration and should be performed at the same time each day. Participants will be instructed to use the device early in the morning between 8 am and 10 am to minimise muscle fatigue that may occur after normal daily activities.\n\nA log diary will be provided to all subjects to record session date, session duration and stimulation intensity during the training period. A student from DCU will attend the participants' home on day 8 to ensure the subject is using the device appropriately as well as adhering to the protocol. Telephone communication will occur weekly on Fridays with each subject in the intervention group to ensure they are adhering to the protocol. The stimulator has a built-in log that records the total number of completed sessions, total treatment time, and average intensities reached for each channel for the previous four sessions. Subjects will not be informed of this facility, so that we can later assess compliance with the diary log. Given that the device will not function unless attached to a subjects' thigh, this will provide reliable means to assess participant adherence to the program. We will document these readings at week 2, week 4, and week 6.\n\nControl group:\nSubjects assigned to the control group will receive standard care. They will attend DCU at baseline, week 3, week 6, and week 12 for quadriceps strength assessments.

The previous cost of the newer generations of oral quinolones was prohibitive and so pharmacokinetics (PK) in such populations could not be justified on the basis of limited application. The availability of cheaper formulations of the oral quinolones coupled with poor prognosis of children with severe malnutrition and gram negative infection on current standard treatment support the value of this study.
