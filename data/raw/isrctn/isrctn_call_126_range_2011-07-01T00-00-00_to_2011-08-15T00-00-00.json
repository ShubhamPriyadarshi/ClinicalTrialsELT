The incidence is estimated to range between 0.6-19 per million per year. Dysfunction of the skin, musculoskeletal system, kidneys, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract as well as painful symptoms, including digital ulcers, Raynaud\u0092s phenomenon, joint contractures and gastro-oesophagal reflux may seriously interfere with all aspects of an individual\u0092s life, with physical, mental and social functioning, as well as overall quality of life being seriously impaired. Although in many other rheumatic conditions the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach (including exercise therapy and patient education) has been established, in systemic sclerosis research in this area is virtually absent. Among patients, there is a strong need for a multidisciplinary treatment programme, however more knowledge regarding its outcomes is needed. In case of proven effectiveness, the programme should be offered to as many patients as possible, however if the intervention is not effective, it should not be recommended. \n\nResearch question: Is a group-based, multidisciplinary treatment programme more effective than usual care in patients with systemic sclerosis?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. 6-minute walk test (metre) \nValidated in patients with rheumatic, cardiac and lung disease and is extensively used in trials in patients with scleroderma aiming at improvement of exercise tolerance.

After testing twice, the highest score was registered. An average value of the grip strength of the left and right hand was computed. \n3.Maximal Mouth Opening (MMO)\nMeasured with a digital calliper as the maximal interdentally distance. Measurement of the maximal mouth opening was used in several studies evaluating mouth function in SSc. \n4. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) \nA standard exercise test on an electronically braked cycle ergo meter performed according to the American Thoracic Society /American College of Chest Physicians (ATS/ACCP) Statement on Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing. At baseline (forehead) pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate and gas exchange were recorded. Pulse oximetry and heart rate were monitored during 1 min of rest, 2 min of unloaded cycling at 60 rpm followed by an increasing load to maximum tolerance, and 3 min of recovery. Each exercise test was supervised by a pulmonary physician. Apart from the VO2 max, maximal rate (Watt), heart rate and ventilation at maximal tolerated work rate were monitored. \n5.

Intervention Groups:\nThe multidisciplinary team care programme is conducted 2 times a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Patients are treated in groups of 4-6 patients. All patients are treated by a multidisciplinary team comprising a rheumatologist, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists and social workers. Additional health professionals are called in to deliver services according to the individual participant's health status. The programme offers a patient-centred approach: After an assessment by all team members, individual goal setting on the level of body functions and structures, daily activities and societal participation is done, in co-operation with the patient. Individual treatment goals are evaluated during weekly multidisciplinary team conferences. The programme consists of individual as well as group interventions:\n1.1. Optimisation of individual medical treatment based on a standardized assessment of all specific medical aspects of the condition (including pulmonary function, ECG with rhythm strip and cardiac echo); If needed, additional assessments (laboratory tests, function tests and imaging) as well as interventions or consultations by other medical specialists are arranged.\n1.2. Exercise therapy, both on an individual basis as well as group therapy. The group exercise programme is aimed at improving joint range of motion, muscle strength, aerobic fitness, and the performance of daily activities. This programme, with a duration of 1.25 hours is conducted two times a week. It has three parts: bicycle training (20 minutes), exercise circuit (20 minutes) and sport or game (20 minutes). Each session is preceded by a warm-up and followed by a cool-down. During the bicycle training, the heart rate is kept at a minimum of 60% of the predicted maximal heart rate (220-age; chest heart rate frequency meter), whereas the rate of perceived exertion (Borg scale; 7-20) is kept between 12-16. The exercise circuit consists of 8-10 different exercises intended to improve muscle strength and endurance, joint mobility and activities of daily living. The sport or game section consists of activities such as badminton or volleyball. The program is supervised by 2 physical therapists on alternate days. In addition to the group exercise programme, individual exercises (with emphasis on hand function improvement and mouth opening exercises) and group hydrotherapy are offered once a week.\n1.3. A group educational program, comprising a number of fixed topics (i.e. information on the disease; medication; skills for coping with pain, disfigurement and disability; skin care; oral hygiene; food and diet) as well as specific items required by participants. Patients receive standardized written information materials (leaflets, books, references to websites). Additional information is provided on an individual basis by all health professionals involved.\n1.4. Occupational therapy, on an individual basis, comprising e.g. the teaching of joint and skin protection and energy conservation strategies and the use of aids and appliances and other relevant products such as stockings and gloves.\n1.5. Guidance by a social worker, on an individual basis tailored to the  individual\u0092s needs (e.g. housing, household assistance, finances, leisure activities or work).  \n\n2. Control Group:\nPatients in the control group will receive usual care as initiated by their attending rheumatologist. Attending rheumatologists will have free choice with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, except for referrals to group exercise or group education programmes or multidisciplinary team care programmes.

Traditional needle acupuncture\n2. Laser acupuncture\n3.

Each patient will be examined by two independent physicians. Patients who meet the diagnostic criteria of rotator cuff tendinitis as assessed by the two physicians will be selected to enter the study. Disagreements between these two physicians will be resolved at the committee meeting. If the disagreement is not resolved, a third opinion by a qualified physician will be obtained. Other patients who do not meet the criteria will be excluded and referred to their family physician.\nAll subjects are then given education about Codman pendulum shoulder exercises to prevent potential shoulder stiffness. Patients are strongly encouraged to continue to take ibuprofen 200 to 600 mg every 6 hours or acetaminophen 320 to 500 mg every 4 hours on an \u0093as needed\u0094 basis. These instructions will be given by one of the evaluating physicians.\nThe patients in all three groups will have ten sessions of metal needle, laser, or sham laser acupuncture treatments over a five week period by the same treating physician as described in the blinding section. Ten treatments are used because of previous systematic review suggests that this is the minimum number of treatments needed to produce sustained clinical effects.\n\nTraditional Acupuncture Group:\nPatients in this group will have needle insertion to a depth of 10-35 mm. The needle is then manually twirled for 30 seconds or until patients feel a dull pressure and warmth feeling around the needle (deqi). The treatment sessions will last 20 minutes with needles manipulated at the 10 minute mark.\nLaser groups:\nA research assistant not involved in the treatment or data analysis will enter the room prior to each laser intervention and flip the switch to either \u0093real treatment\u0094 or \u0093placebo\u0094 according to the group the patient has been randomly assigned to. The patient and the treating physician will be blinded to this procedure and will enter the room only after the research assistant exits the area. The laser leads will then be applied to the same points used for the metal needle acupuncture group. The patient will remain hooked up to the machine for twenty minutes to produce 20 joules energy per point at 810 nm infrared laser.\nThe Shoulder Pain and Disability Index and the Oxford Analgesic Chart will be given before each treatment by the blinded research assistant. The assistants will also contact the patients at three and six months after completing their course of treatments. Each patient will keep a log of the amount of ibuprofen and acetaminophen used using the Oxford analgesic chart, which will be confirmed by the research assistant weekly.

The CS group was encouraged in the formation of a positive peer group that focused on developing skills in mathematics and English.

CHF progresses because of the activation of neurohormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) deficiency, following an initial cardiac injury such as Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), statin toxicity or a mutation of the genetic programme. It is becoming increasingly apparent that inflammatory mediators play a crucial role in the development of CHF and AMI and several strategies to counterbalance different aspects of the inflammatory response are considered. Possible targets involve pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and their receptors, endotoxin, adhesion molecules, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase, reactive oxygen species, CoQ and L-carnitine in mitochondria and different types of leucocytes.\n\nThe most important cytokines implicated in the progression of CHF are Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF-alpha), Interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6. These cytokines share some of their major characteristics (redundancy), and all act in a pro-inflammatory sense. Among those, TNF-alpha is the cytokine that has been studied in greatest detail. IL-10 is anti-inflammatory which is beneficial in heart failure. Cytokines form a vast array of relative low molecular weight, pharmacologically active proteins. These substances are secreted by different cell types for the purpose of altering either their own function (autocrine) or that of adjacent cells (paracrine). Several hypotheses have been suggested to describe the origin of immune activation in CHF. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has mostly been attributed to secretion by mononuclear cells, although the myocardium seems to be another important source. Some evidence suggests that catecholamines augment this myocardial cytokine production. There is evidence that CoQ and carnitine may be beneficial in patients with heart failure. \n\nIn the present study, we examine, that ubiquinol, in conjunction with L-carnitine, can decrease cytokines and may be useful in patients with CHF.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.

Participants will be randomised to Arm A (usual eczema care + water softener for 12 weeks followed by 4 weeks with unit removed) or Arm B (usual eczema care for 12 weeks followed by delayed installation for the final 4 weeks of the study period). \nIon-exchange water softening units will be compared with usual eczema care. Ion exchange water softening is a scientifically defined, understood and described process using a synthetic polystyrene resin in which primarily the divalent cations (positively charged), calcium and magnesium found in domestic water supplies, are replaced by the monovalent cation, sodium, from common salt. Ion-exchange water softening units typically reduce the water hardness to practically zero . \nAll units will be installed in the child\u0092s principal residence and salt will be supplied for the duration of the trial. Standard procedure will be to soften all water in the home, and provide mains drinking water through an extra (faucet-style) tap installed at the side of the kitchen sink. Apart from having a unit installed in the home, participants will continue with their usual eczema treatments in the usual way and will be asked to bathe / wash their clothes according to their usual practice. The units will meet all necessary quality standards, and will be installed by a trained water engineer according to British Water\u0092s code of practice. \nThe water softeners to be used in this trial will be supplied and paid for by a consortium of representatives from the water softener industry, co-ordinated through their Trade Association (UK Water Treatment Association). The units will be encased in an unmarked box in order to prevent the possibility of commercial advantage to any particular company. \n\nHypotheses:\n1.  The installation of an ion-exchange water softener will help to relieve the symptoms of eczema in children with moderate to severe eczema\n2. The installation of an ion-exchange water softener will result in cost implications to both patients and the NHS.\n\nThere is epidemiological evidence linking increasing water hardness with increasing atopic eczema prevalence. This was first demonstrated by the current research team in an ecological study published in The Lancet of 4141 randomly selected primary school children in the Nottingham area (McNally et al, 1998). The 1-year period prevalence of eczema was 17.3% in the hardest water category and 12.0% in the lowest (odds ratio of 1.54, 1.19-1.99 after adjustment for confounders). Similar results have recently been found in Japan (Miyake et al, 2004).\n\nIf the above associations are true, a number of plausible mechanisms can be forwarded to suggest why hard water could exacerbate eczema.  Perhaps the most likely explanation is increased soap usage in hard water areas; the deposits of which can cause skin irritation in eczema sufferers. A direct chemical irritant effect from calcium and magnesium salts is also possible, or an indirect effect of enhanced allergen penetration from skin barrier disruption. \n\nMcNally NJ, Williams HC, Phillips DR et al.

It avoids the need to use two different age-specific dermatology quality of life scales (the Children\u0092s Dermatology Life Quality Index  and the Infants version of the same scale)\n6.

The evaluation will be performed from the perspective of the payer: direct non-medical, indirect and intangible costs will not be estimated.  \n\nCost estimates will be calculated using data collected at baseline and throughout the intervention period (e.g. hospitalisations, number of consultations), in conjunction with national accounting statistics representative of unit costs surveyed across the United Kingdom. The cost of patient drugs will be obtained from the standard Drug Tariff.  Resource use data will be collected for 12 months prior to baseline and for 365 days (to standardise calculation of unit costs) after enrolment or until death.  Mean annual cost estimates for each type of resource group will be shown separately (e.g. drug cost, hospitalisations, General Practitioner visits) and compared pre- and post-enrolment and by allocation to control or intervention group.\n\nA secondary outcome to be evaluated in this study will be professional satisfaction of intervention prescribing support pharmacists, GPs and nurses (of intervention residents) with the programme.

It is surprisingly under-researched and as background to this study we have previously undertaken two pilot studies - a questionnaire study and a feasibility study.\nEar wax is commonly treated by syringing the ear and syringing has been shown to improve hearing and symptoms. However, most GPs have increasingly delegated managing ear wax to practice nurses. The annual salary costs of practice nurses undertaking ear syringing in UK general practice have been estimated at about \u00a38 million. Could that time be better spent? Achieving current NHS targets (such as the New GP Contract) has significant workload implications. Patients do not like delays associated with treating ear wax and patients, GPs and practice nurses would like to encourage such self-help. In some countries plastic bulb syringes with which to irrigate the ear are widely available. Such devices could potentially be marketed in the UK. Their availability in the UK and evidence of their effectiveness and safety could both reduce demands on health service resources and satisfy patients' demands for rapid relief of symptoms.

This causes severe disruption to the educational and social aspects of life for these patients. The financial implications for the health service are also considerable. A recent analysis revealed a cost of \u00a32.5 million per annum for South East London Health Authority. Research conducted in America revealed that pain management strategies that incorporate a psychological intervention can significantly reduce casualty visits and hospital admissions. A pilot study using cognitive therapy has been carried out to assess the feasibility of using this approach in patients with Sickle Cell Disease in London. Results have shown that patients are generally very positive about this approach and consider it to be beneficial in terms of reducing psychological distress, providing emotional support and in improving confidence levels. There was a significant reduction in the duration of hospital stay when compared to the control group.\n\nThe present study seeks to extend the pilot study by evaluating of a community-based cognitive therapy intervention of the pain experience and well-being of 120 adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease. The result of this study is likely to make significant contributions to knowledge by providing detailed information about the types of coping strategies used by patients with SCD.

This may be appropriate treatment for psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations or delusions, but use of these drugs to control behavioural symptoms that may arise out of agitation for example is controversial. Major tranquillizers are highly effective in the treatment of hallucinations and delusions, but the little evidence that we have suggests that they have only modest efficacy in improving behavioural symptoms. In contrast to the lack of evidence that these drugs are helpful in the treatment of people with dementia, there are clear costs associated with their use. All of these drugs have side-effects to which people with dementia are particularly sensitive. Further, some researchers believe that use of these drugs may be associated with an accelerated decline in dementia.\n\nThe aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness and acceptability of alternatives to regular psychotropic prescription within those people with dementia who present the most serious behavioural problems and who would thus be most likely to receive drug treatment.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.
