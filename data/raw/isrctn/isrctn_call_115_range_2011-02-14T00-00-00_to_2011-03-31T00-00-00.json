The GAITRite walkway was extended with a 2.5 meter carpet at the end and beginning of the active area to eliminate the effect of acceleration or deceleration and allow for steady state gait assessment.\n2.

Computer Game Exercise Program:\nParticipants allocated to computer game (CGame) underwent a regimen of twice weekly progressive resistance training of the core and lower extremities muscle groups, progressive postural balance training and progressive computer game dancing for twelve weeks.\n\nThe muscle groups for the strength training were chosen because of their importance in functional activities and were trained in standing position. During standing participants were secured with ropes they could hold on to (Redcord AS, NO-4920 Staubo, Norway). The ropes were fixated on the ceiling or on frames. The focus of exercise was on functional activities of daily living such as walking, standing up from a chair, sitting down or stair climbing. The aim for each exercise was to perform two sets of 15 repetitions. To maintain the intensity of the stimulus during training, the load was increased at each training session, as tolerated by the participants, with the help of sand filled cuffs worn on the ankle or waist. The increase of load was controlled using a Borg exercise-intensity scale for verbally assessing proper intensity.\n\nBalance exercises were performed with a maximum of four individuals training at the same time. All exercises could be adjusted to the individual mobility level. The intensity was gradually increased and previously formulated recommendations were applied: participants performed 1-2 sets of 3-5 different exercises emphasising dynamic postures with progressive difficulty as tolerated.\n\nStimuli in the dancing game were five dance songs with no lyrics (90\u0097130 beats per minute [BPM]; mean = 115 BPM). Songs were edited into 30 seconds (30-s) segments and individualised files comprising dance steps synchronised to the music were created. Each 30-s segment was triplicated, resulting in five stimuli, each 1 min 30 s in length, and each containing 3 identical repeats of a song and step-sequence pairing. Songs were then paired with visual cues instructing the participant how to dance to that track. A scrolling display of arrows moving upwards across the screen cued each move and the participant had to make the indicated step when the arrows reached the top of the screen. The symbolic arrow sequences were generated for all five tracks. StepMania (www.stepmania.com), a freeware program similar to the video game Dance Dance Revolution (Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc., Redwood City, CA), was used for step file modification and training. Participants performed dance training on a dance pad connected by USB to a desktop computer and with projection of the symbolic arrows on a wall with a beamer. There was a one minute break between dances. Electronic sensors in the dance pad detected position and timing information that was then used to provide participants with real-time visual feedback.\n\nA room in every residential care facility that was easily accessible to the older people was dedicated for the set up of the training equipment. All classes started with 5-10 minutes of warm-up activities, followed by 10-15 minutes of strength training exercises, 10-15 minutes of balance skills training, 1.5-7.5 minutes of computer game dancing and 5-10 minutes of cooling-down activities. Training sessions lasted 45-60 minutes and were separated by at least one day of rest. All exercise sessions were supervised individually by two qualified exercise trainers.\n\n2. Conventional Exercise Program:\nAll participants in the usual care (UCare) exercise program underwent a regimen of once a week 30 to 45 minutes of training under the guidance of qualified leaders in \u0093Sports for Seniors\u0094 (Seniorensportleiter). This is a qualification received from the Swiss Federal Office of Sport (BASPO; www.baspo.admin.ch) and acknowledges that the exercise leader has been educated and is qualified to develop and implement health enhancing physical activity programs for adult populations. Participants in UCare were training in a group on a chair where the seats were aligned circularly. The chairs were used to secure participants for exercises that were performed in standing. Every training session was partitioned in three parts; warm-up, strength & balance and cool-down. The 5-10 minutes warming-up activities were flexibility exercises that were sometimes combined with cognitive activities (e.g., memorizing animal names whilst throwing each other a ball). The strength and balance part took approximately 20-25 minutes and focused on muscle exercises for the arms and the lower extremities (1-2 sets per exercise were performed with a maximum of eight repetitions per set). The 5-10 minutes cool-down phase consisted of relaxation exercises. The program can be considered as representative for the usual care offered in residential care facilities. A room in every residential care facility that was easily accessible to the older people was dedicated for the set up of the training.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder20820-0", "contactId": "Contact58830_20820", "sponsorId": "Sponsor57420"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact58830_20820", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Eling D.", "surname": "de Bruin", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "ETH Zurich, HIT J 32.3\nWolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 27", "city": "Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "zip": "CH-8093", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+41 44 632 40 18"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "debruin@move.biol.ethz.ch"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor57420", "organisation": "Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Z\u00fcrich) (Switzerland)", "website": "http://www.ibws.ethz.ch", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "ETH Zurich, HIT J 32.3\nc/o E.D. de Bruin\nWolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 27", "city": "Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "zip": "CH-8093", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+41 44 632 40 18"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "debruin@move.biol.ethz.ch"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.5801.c", "rorId": "https://ror.org/05a28rw58"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder20820-0", "name": "Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich (ETH Z\u00fcrich) (Switzerland)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-03-10T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "21", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2011-03-10T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "72642831"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Meningococcal C Conjugate Brazilian Vaccine Project", "scientificTitle": "Immunogenicity and safety in children 1 - 9 years of a vaccine against meningococcal serogroup C strain 2135 produced with tetanus toxoid conjugate", "acronym": "Meningococcal C Conjugate Vaccine Brazilian", "studyHypothesis": "This a non-inferiority study to test that the experiment vaccine confers the same amount of protection as the reference vaccine.

The intervention period ended 6 hours post-operatively. Patients were followed for 30 days post-operatively. \n\nEstablishment and calibration of the LiDCO-plus-system were carried out by a member of the research team who had no involvement in the peri- and post-operative care and decision making. This allowed complete blinding of both surgical, anaesthetic and Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) clinical teams to LiDCO-plus-system readings in the control group. \n\nAll anaesthetic interventions were at the discretion of the anaesthetist responsible for the peri-operative management of the patient. All patients were fasting over night and no pre-operative intravenous fluids were given. Patients received general anaesthesia with fentanyl, thiopental, rocuronium and sevoflurane in oxygen/air or spinal anaesthesia with bupivacain 0.5% spinal solution. In all patients an epidural catheter was inserted at the L3-L4 level and an epidural infusion of bupivacain with fentanyl was initiated before start of surgery or after two hours, if spinal anaesthesia was used and continued until postoperative day 2 or 3. \n\nStandard monitoring for both groups included continuous pulse oxymetri, electrocardiography, invasive arterial and central venous blood pressure monitoring, and spirometry with inspiratory and expiratory oxygen, carbon dioxide and anaesthetic gas monitoring. Arterial blood gases were analysed at predefined points in both groups. \n\nStroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI) and oxygen delivery index (DO2I) were continuously monitored, by lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis using the LiDCO-plus-system in all patients, but data was blinded in the control group. \n\nAll patients were treated to achieve a heart rate less than 100 bpm or less than 20% above baseline, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 60 - 100 mgHg, a central venous pressure (CVP) between 4 - 16, body temperature greater than 36.5\u00b0C, an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) greater than 94%, a haemoglobin concentration greater than 6 mmol/l, and an urine output greater than 0.5 - 1.0 ml/min/kg in the post-operative period.\n\nIn all patients crystalloid, colloid, blood products and vasopressors were administered in the peri-and post-operative periods by the anaesthetist based on intra- and post-operative losses, standard haemodynamic parameters and blood-gases. \n\nIntervention: \nPatients in the intervention group received 250 ml boluses of intravenous colloid solution (Voluven\u00ae, Fresenius Kabi AB, Upsala, Sweden) to achieve a sustained rise in SVI of at least 10% for 20 minutes in the peri- and post-operative period. Fluid boluses of Voluven\u00ae were repeated if SV subsequently decreased or if there was clinical suspicion of hypovolaemia. Furthermore, in the post-operative period, the IGDT group received dobutamine up to a maximum of 10 \u00b5g/kg/min if DO2I did not reach 600 ml/min/m2 with intravenous fluid alone.

ICP-measurement: All patients will be monitored by invasive ICP-measurement. The monitoring device can be selected by the treating study center. We recommend measuring in hemisphere ipsilaterally to the ICH or an EVD, respectively. The EVD should be positioned to 15 cm above the level of the foramen Monroi to avoid overdrainage and subsequent complications. \n2. Osmotherapy: Hyperosmolaric therapy will be initiated in case of an ICP-crisis. An ICP-crisis is defined by plausible increase of the ICP above 20 mmHg for a period of 15 min or more. Hyperosmolar therapy includes mannitol (e.g. Osmofundin\u00e2 100 ml 15%-solution, initial dose 4 per day) or glycerol (e.g. Glycerosteril\u00e2 250 ml 10%-solution, initial dose 4 per day). Further dosing will be adjusted to at least daily measured serum osmolality (target value: 315 to 320 mOsm). If this treatment does not lead to a sufficient improvement of clinical signs of hernation and/or ICP-reduction below 20 mmHg, hypertonic saline is given in a dose of 50 ml 5- to 7.5%. In case of ICP-crisis, hypertonic saline can be given repeatedly until a serum level of 158mmol/l. Other ICP-reducing approaches such as barbiturate use and/or hyperventilation are not recommended.\n3. Intubation and mechanical ventilation:  Mechanical ventilation will be initiated at a Glasgow-Coma-Scale (GCS) Score of 8 or less, during global respiratory insufficiency (pO2<60 mmHg, pCO2>48 mmHg) or/and in case of mechanical respiratory problems, Target parameters in mechanically ventilated patients are: pO2>75mmHg, pCO2 36-44 mmHg. In case of ICP-crisis a pO2>100mmHg should be reached.\n4. Patients with additional intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can be included into the study, if there is a local protocol for intracventricular lysis and lumbar drainage. Centers lacking the described protocol cannot include patients which additional IVH.\n5. Sedation: The medication for sedation can be selected by the local PI. \n6. Blood pressure management (BPM): BPM will be done according to the recent guidelines. The upper limit of systolic blood pressure is 140 to 170 mmHg. The antihypertensive medication can be selected by the local PI.\n7. Body temperature: Body core temperature will be measured in the urinary bladder. Increase of body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C will be treated by antipyretics (AHA guidelines), cold infusions or/and surface cooling. These methods should not lower the body core temperature below 36.5\u00b0C.\n8. The hemoglobin concentration should be above 9.0 g/dl. Lower values should be treated by erythrocyte transfusions. \n9. Patients should receive subcutaneously low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis within 24 hours after ICH after exclusion of hemorhage growth in the 24-h control CT.\n10. A recent study has shown, that patients with large ICH require cranial CT at least 4-5 times during NICU-stay, since the value of the neurological examination in mechanically ventilated, sedated patients is limited and the course of ICH is often not predictable and can be very dynamic (re-bleeding, increase of PHE, occlusion hydrocephalus). Patients of the CINCH-study will have cranial CTs within the following defined time periods after ICH to enable later comparison of cCTs between the groups: on admission, 24\u00b13 hours after admission, 36-72 after ICH and at day 8+0,5 and 11+0,5 after ICH symptom onset. Patients can be monitored by additional transcranial ultrasound. \n \nIntervention: Therapeutic hypothermia\nPatients randomised to TH are treated with an endovascular catheter-based cooling system positioned in the femoral vein as described previously (15). The target temperature is set to 35.0\u00b0C. The body core temperature is measured by a urinary bladder catheter. As soon as body core temperature drops below 36.0\u00b0C, patients are covered by a warming blanket to avoid shivering. 8 days (192 hours) after initiation of TH, patients receive slowly, controlled rewarmed by 0.05\u00b0C per hour (approximately within 40 hours). The catheter will be changed at least once during the treatment period, preferably on day 4\u00b10.5 after ICH, or if clinically indicated. All patients will be screened for deep venous thrombosis at least twice (day 0 to 5 first ultrasound, day 6 to 9 second ultrasound). Blood testing for coagulation will be performed before, during and after cooling. \n\nTotal follow-up is 6 months.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder20709-0", "contactId": "Contact58715_20709", "sponsorId": "Sponsor57304"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact58715_20709", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Rainer", "surname": "Kollmar", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "University Hospital Erlangen\nFriedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg\nSchwabachanlage 6", "city": "Erlangen", "country": "Germany", "zip": "91054", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "rainer.kollmar@uk-erlangen.de"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor57304", "organisation": "University Hospital Erlangen (Germany)", "website": "http://www.uk-erlangen.de/", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Neurology\nFriedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg\nSchwabachanlage 6", "city": "Eralngen", "country": "Germany", "zip": "91054", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "rainer.kollmar@uk-erlangen.de"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.411668.c", "rorId": "https://ror.org/0030f2a11"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder20709-0", "name": "University of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (Germany)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-02-17T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "20", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2011-02-17T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "77299467"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Renal structure and function in type 2 diabetes", "scientificTitle": "Renal structure and function in type 2 diabetes: an observational, longitudinal case-control and single-centred study", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "Little is known about the relationships between renal structural changes and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

All patients were attending a single renal service where the decision to commence iron and ESA therapy was made by the attending physician. \n\nThe study consisted of two groups. The first group (A) were patients selected for iron therapy according to clinical need and the second group (B) of patients were those needing ESA treatment.\n\nIron Therapy Group (A):\nAll patients selected for iron therapy had either absolute or functional iron deficiency as evidenced by serum ferritin values less than 200 \u00b5g/L. All patients had haemoglobin less than or equal to 10.5 g/dl. Patients in this group were not on previous or concurrent ESA therapy and were vitamin B12 and folate replete.\n\nErythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) therapy Group (B):\nAll patients receiving ESA therapy had haemoglobin less than or equal to 10.5 g/dl and were considered iron, vitamin B12 and folate replete prior to initiation. Patients were considered iron replete following a serum ferritin value greater than 200 \u00b5g/L or having received intravenous iron at least 6 weeks prior to ESA therapy.\n\nSample analysis and monitoring of glycaemic control:\nPatients in groups A and B were provided with the Abbott Freestyle Freedom Lite glucose sensor (Abbott Diagnostics, Maidenhead, UK).

Using this system, measurements of interstitial glucose levels were made 228 times over a 24 hour period. This was done in parallel with patient 7PGM over the period of CGMS to allow accurate correlation of glycaemic control. All patients had CGMS performed for at least 2 days prior to ESA therapy and once again at the end of the study. \n\nResults from the 7PGM and CGMS were downloaded from their respective meters for data analysis. Results from the CGMS included at least a successful 24 hour profile over the monitoring period with no gaps greater than 120 mins.\n\nThe management of diabetes control were left to the patients and their health care professional. Treatment for glycaemic control was monitored throughout the study period.\n\nBlood was drawn fasting from all patients for HbA1c and full blood profile.

Participation to the 4-hour \"Smoking Prevention Track\" (SPT), a workshop of 4 sessions at the LILT \"Prevention Place\" Center in Reggio Emilia, Italy\n2. Participation to a School Smoking Prevention Program (check of the School Smoke-Free Policy and a Peer Education Program on smoking prevention)\n\n1. \"Smoking Prevention Track\" (SPT) at the LILT \"Prevention Place\" Center: \nThe 4-hour SPT is characterised by four 40-minute sessions every first class of intervention schools has to attend during one morning. Every class is divided into two groups, and each group attends four different 40-minute sessions. The four sessions are led by LILT educators aged 25 - 35 years old:\n1.1. Lab session: 10 minutes for explanation of physiology of the respiratory system; 20 minutes of laboratory trials for separating different smoking substances (tar, particulate matters, nicotine, carbon dioxide, nitrite oxides) using lab instruments. In the last 10 minutes a portable laser-operated aerosol analyzer with a sampling time of 2 minutes, is used in real time in order to measure Particulate Matters (PM2.5, PM10) when a cigarette is lit. Then a student expires on the analyzer, in order to show that the human respiratory system holds most part of PM2.5 during the breath.\n1.2. Computer session: every student of a group at a personal computer fills in 3 - 5 score tests and calculate his/her overall score. At the end of every test, students can know his/her level according to his or her own final score. Tests are:\n1.2.1. Self-evaluation test on physical and psychological wellness (all)\n1.2.2. Self-evaluation test on stress levels (all)\n1.2.3. Test on curiosity level about smoking (non-smokers)\n1.2.4. The Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (smokers)\n1.2.5. Self-evaluation test on motivation to quit (smokers)\n1.2.6. Self-evaluation test on motivation to be a sustained non-smokers (former smokers)\n1.3. Creative Writing session: the session begins with some readings about smoking. Then the session is divided into two parts: \n1.3.1. \"Smoking Signs\": students divide a paper sheet into four parts in which they write four headings: smoking and emotions, thoughts, experiences, key-words. Every student fills in the four parts of the sheet using words and sentences, according to the headings.\n1.3.2. \"Personal Feeling of Smoking\": students divide a paper sheet into three parts in which they write the following headings: feelings, beliefs, experiences. Every student fills in the three parts of the sheet using words and sentences, according to the headings.\n1.4. Imagination session: after few minutes of relaxation and deep breathing in a room with comfortable arm chairs, a novel is read aloud to the group. The novel describes the experience of smoking a cigarette during a Saturday night party in a disco-club. Students may identify themselves with the character. In the novel there are a lot of questions about the emotions that the character feels from smoking, and holding a cigarette.\n\n2. Check of the School Smoke-Free Policy: \nCompliance of the smoking ban and the presence of no-smoking signs in aisles, in teacher rooms, in toilets, and in other rooms of the schools, are checked and verified.\n\nPeer Education Program on smoking prevention:\nA group of self-selected peers of every experimental school (students attending the third class aged 15 - 16 years) are trained by LILT educators in a one-day session at the LILT \"Prevention Place\" Center and three 2-hour sessions at school. Trained peers organise a 2-hour meeting in every first class involved in the experimental arm. Peers may participate to the \"Peer Award\", a competition among schools of the experimental arm to select the best strategy and material created by peers themselves for presenting smoking issue in an innovative way to 13 - 14 year old students.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18787-0", "contactId": "Contact56780_18787", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55354"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56780_18787", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Sandra", "surname": "Bosi", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "\"Luoghi di Prevenzione\" \nc/o ex-ospedale Spallanzani -viale Umberto I, 50", "city": "Reggio Emilia", "country": "Italy", "zip": "42100", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+39 (0)522 320 655"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "sandrabosi@libero.it"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55354", "organisation": "Italian League Against Cancer (LILT) (Italy)", "website": "http://www.legatumorireggio.it", "sponsorType": "Research organisation", "contactDetails": {"address": "Provincial section of Reggio Emilia\n\"Luoghi di Prevenzione\"\nc/o ex-ospedale Spallanzani - viale Umberto I, 50", "city": "Reggio Emilia", "country": "Italy", "zip": "42100", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+39 (0)522 320 655"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "prevenzione@legatumorireggio.it"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.429138.5", "rorId": "https://ror.org/02g2x7380"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder18787-0", "name": "Ministry of Health (Italy) - Emilia-Romagna Region", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-02-23T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "24", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2009-06-29T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "07575807"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Reducing home hazards to prevent falls in older people", "scientificTitle": "Environmental assessment and modification to prevent falls in older people: a randomised controlled single centre trial", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in outcome in people who receive occupational therapist-led environmental assessment aiming to reduce falls as compared to those who receive the same intervention from a trained assessor.\n\nThe aim of this study was to pilot a randomised controlled trial to develop and test the methods to be used in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT), which would investigate the clinical effectiveness of environmental assessment and modification in the prevention of falls in older people.

Treatment group: UDCA 500 mg twice daily (bd). The dose will be increased in increments of 500 mg per day every 3 - 14 days if there is no biochemical or clinical improvement until a maximum of 2 grams per day is reached. Criteria for increasing the dose will be no improvement in itching or a rise in serum transaminases or bile acids. If there is no response to this dose, the dose can be increased up to 3 grams per day at the discretion of the treating clinician. The decision to increase the dose will always be at the discretion of the treating clinician.\n2. Control group: placebo capsule will be increased according to the same regime. \n\nComparison B: 'Planned delivery by thirty-seven weeks' versus 'await spontaneous delivery at term' - \nParticipants who are recruited at or before 37+6 will be randomised to: \n1. Deliver by thirty-seven weeks\n2. Await spontaneous delivery at term\n\nNOTE: We recognise that there is now evidence to support the induction of even uncomplicated pregnancy by (40+10) term plus 10 days. Obstetricians are permitted to induce participants in the \u0093await spontaneous delivery\u0094 group from 40+0 weeks, or as clinical needs dictate.\n\nMethods of analysis: (Additional information updated on 23/03/2011)\nTrial analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and the most recent CONSORT guidelines (Moher et al. 2010). Women and neonates will be analysed according to the original randomised allocation, irrespective of compliance and crossovers. \n\nIn all analyses, regression methods will be used and adjustment will be made for stratification variables (gestation at recruitment - UDCA trial only, and centre \u0096 both trials); for the other randomised treatment (three categories: randomised to option A, to option B or non-randomised) and for potential confounders (baseline bile acid levels, and others where there is a substantial imbalance).  \n\nAnalysis of perinatal outcomes will treat all infants (singletons or twins) equally.  To allow for multiple pregnancy, standard errors will be adjusted for clustering by mother using the Huber-White sandwich estimator, and multiplicity will be included as a covariate (Rogers 1993). The use of p-values will be kept to a minimum, in order to concentrate attention on the size of the real and substantial effects of the intervention (or lack of them).  \n\nFor continuous outcomes (such as VAS & biochemistry) covariates will include the baseline measurement (Frison & Pocock 1992). Analysis of biochemical markers will be based on logged values, because of the spread and distribution of values. The treatment effect will be presented as a concentration ratio (the ratio between treatment groups of the geometric mean concentration post-randomisation). Results will be presented graphically as the continuous measure (VAS and biochemistry) against days post randomisation, as the influence of UDCA is likely to be considerably greater than any gestational change in the variable. \n\nRisk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) will be estimated for Yes/No outcomes; binary regression with a log-link (for RR) and a linear link (for RD) will be used.  For pre-planned composite endpoints, all distinct components will also be analysed, and results reported as significant or otherwise accordingly (Cordoba 2010).\n\nTime to delivery will be treated as partially censored data, and analysed using Cox\u0092s proportional Hazards.  For the UDCA trial, censoring will be at delivery (if after 37 weeks) for pregnancies randomised to the early delivery arm of the other trial, and undergoing IoL or C/S due to trial allocation (rather than maternal/fetal compromise or maternal/obstetrician request); and otherwise at 40 weeks.  For the timing-of-delivery trial, censoring will be at 40 weeks in all cases.\n\nEstimates with confidence intervals are generally preferred to p-values, in order to concentrate attention on the size of the real and substantial effects of the intervention (or lack of them).  In general p-values will only be given for the pre-declared and powered primary and main secondary endpoints.  \n\nSubgroup analyses & interaction tests\nInteraction tests will be used in conjunction with any subgroup analyses.  \n\nThe principal subgroup is level of bile acids at baseline (continuous and in 3 categories - mild: bile acids = 14 \u00b5mol/L, ALT > 100 U/L, moderate: bile acids 15\u009640 \u00b5mol/L, severe: bile acids > 40 \u00b5mol/L).  Interaction tests will be used, to determine whether apparent differences in treatment effect between groups can be interpreted real (i.e. not due to chance only); and hence if it is possible to indentify subgroups that benefit or do not benefit from randomised treatment.\n\nAnalysis will be conducted in the statistical package Stata, version 11.1 or later (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2009 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19445704 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "91838f29-1d45-4636-b2ba-8b3d2e81e6c3", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2009-05-16T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19445704"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder17923-0", "contactId": "Contact55906_17923", "sponsorId": "Sponsor54470"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55906_17923", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Vinita", "surname": "Gurung", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Clinical Research Fellow\nAcademic division of obstetrics and gynaecology\nNottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust\nCity Campus\nHucknall Road", "city": "Nottingham", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NG5 1PB", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)115 823 1896"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "gurungvinita@doctors.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor54470", "organisation": "University of Nottingham (UK)", "website": "http://nottingham.ac.uk", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "c/o Paul Cartledge\nHead of Research Grants and Contracts\nResearch Innovation Services\nKing's Meadow Campus\nLenton Lane", "city": "Nottingham", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NG7 2NR", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)115 846 6418"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "paul.cartledge@nottingham.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.4563.4", "rorId": "https://ror.org/01ee9ar58"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder17923-0", "name": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (UK) - Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) Programme", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-02-23T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "24", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2008-06-12T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "03844341"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "A randomised controlled trial to assess the LifeStraw\u00ae Family household gravity filter", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "The objectives of the study are:\n1.

The previous sponsor was St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto (Canada).", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Pilot Study: \nMean headache score associated with each of intermittent NTG and ISMO use. Subjects will be given four seven day diaries, with a visual analogue scale (VAS) for each day of both treatment periods and the wash out period. Subjects will rate their headache upon awakening on a daily basis; our previous study demonstrated that subjects randomised to ISMO who developed headaches reported that the headache was most severe upon awakening and gradually subsided over the day. The VAS uses a 100 mm continuous horizontal line with the left pole labeled 'no headache' and the right pole labeled 'terrible headache'; subjects will be instructed to draw a vertical line intersecting the VAS indicating the severity of their morning headache. We will calculate the mean headache score with intermittent NTG and intermittent ISMO for each subject. Then we will calculate the mean headache score for all subjects when taking ISMO and when taking NTG. The nitrate that gives the lowest mean headache score will be used in our main study. Our earlier work indicates that the nitrate formulation associated with the most severe headaches will result in the greatest number of drop outs. The VAS can detect subtle changes in subjective complaints (i.e. headache), has documented reliability, and has been used in several studies designed to study the effects of NTG ointment on headache in healthy women.  \n\nMain Study: \nChange from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine over 24 months among women randomised to treatment compared with women randomised to placebo. BMD will be measured (on the same machine in all subjects) at the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) using a Lunar DPX-L bone densitometer (Lunar Corporation, Madison WI). A single experienced technician, certified by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) and blinded to the treatment assignment, will perform all BMD measurements. The intraclass correlation coefficient for BMD measurements is 0.98. The PI will be blinded to treatment assignment and will report the BMD. BMD reporting is objective and based on standard ISCD criteria.", "secondaryOutcome": "Main study:\n1. Change from baseline in total hip BMD. This will provide information about the effects of nitrates on cortical and trabecular bone and ultimately on the ability of nitrates to prevent hip fractures.  \n2. Change from baseline in bone formation and bone resorption markers. Measuring markers of bone turnover will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which intermittent nitrates increase BMD (i.e. a decrease in bone resorption and/or an increase in bone formation). We will measure bone turnover markers three months after initiating calcium and vitamin D because we expect a 10% decrease in markers with the use of supplements, and the maximal change in bone markers is typically observed at three months. Thus, we will be assessing any additional effects of intermittent nitrates on markers of bone turnover in women receiving calcium and vitamin D supplements. Urinary NTx will be measured on a second morning urine sample using a monoclonal antibody technique (Osteomark). The intra-assay variability is 7.6% and the inter-assay variability is 4.0%. Serum BSAP will be measured on a fasting serum sample using a monoclonal antibody technique (Metra Biosystems). The intra-assay variability is 5.8% and the inter-assay variability is 5.2%. To minimise variability, subjects will be given written and verbal instructions on how to collect the second morning urine sample; for each subject we will collect all the samples (baseline, three, 12 and 24 months post-randomisation) at the same time, and we will store the blood and urine at -70\u00b0C and analyze all the samples together in a single laboratory. We will compare measures of bone turnover markers at 3, 12, and 24 months after randomisation using a repeated measure of analysis of variance. By measuring markers at three months we will be able to directly compare these results to the findings in our earlier study. By measuring markers at 12 and 24 months we will be able to evaluate to a limited degree, the question of tachyphylaxis with nitrates. Recall that in our earlier study we found a decrease in markers of bone resorption and an increase in markers of bone formation after 90 days of treatment with intermittent ISMO. Measuring markers after one and two years of treatment will allow us to determine if there is still a marked decrease in bone resorption and increase in bone formation; no further changes in markers may indicate that the effects of nitrates on bone is transient.\n3. Adverse events. Adverse events will be assessed using a standardized, validated interviewer administered questionnaire on a monthly basis by telephone. We will assess nitrate and non nitrate related adverse events. Documentation of adverse events is critical before proceeding to a larger, longer study of intermittent nitrates and fractures.\n4. Bone Microarchitecture. Fracture risk is influenced by both the quantity of bone (assessed by BMD) and quality of bone. Features of bone quality include trabecular and cortical volumetric bone density, measures of bone geometry, and trabecular texture. We will measure trabecular and cortical volumetric bone densities at the radius and tibia using an XCT2000 pQCT scanner at Hamilton Health Sciences. Transaxial images will also be processed to yield values of bone geometry and trabecular bone texture. Measurements of trabecular bone structure discriminate women with low BMD and fracture from women with low BMD but no fracture. As such, they may be particularly important when assessing the effect of a new treatment on fractures. The various measurements produced by pQCT will allow us to describe the effects of nitrates on the various compartments of bone.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "1.

All subjects will be instructed to take the nitrate, identified in the pilot study to be the best tolerated, daily for one week. Subjects who do not develop headaches during the nitrate run-in phase will enter the main trial.

Subjects will receive a 3 month supply of study medication, calcium, and vitamin D, and will receive standard verbal and written instructions on how to take the medication, calcium, and vitamin D. At 3 months post-randomisation, subjects will return to the study centre and provide blood and urine samples for bone turnover markers; unused calcium, vitamin D, and study medication will be collected and counted, and subjects will be given a nine month supply of study medication, calcium, and vitamin D. At 12 and 24 months post-randomisation, subjects will visit the study centre and provide blood and urine samples for bone turnover markers; the unused calcium, vitamin D and study medication will be counted (at the 12 month post-randomisation visit we will provide a 12 month supply of calcium, vitamin D and study medication) and we will obtain BMD and pQCT assessments.\n\nContact details for patient information sheet:\nCeleste Hamilton  BHK, MSc\nResearch Coordinator\nOsteoporosis Research Program\nWomen's College Hospital\nTel: +1 416 323 6400 ext. 4824\nFax: +1 416 323 7513\nEmail: celeste.hamilton@wchospital.ca", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": "Nitrates"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2006 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16640783 results\n2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21343579 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": [{"@id": "8dfc59bb-5920-47fe-9c27-71463ed8422c", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2006-04-26T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16640783"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "2a169a62-ce3a-4980-8566-d36a75cecd52", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-02-23T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21343579"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}]}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder14215-0", "contactId": "Contact51931_14215", "sponsorId": "Sponsor50362"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51931_14215", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Abida Sophina", "surname": "Jamal", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "76 Grenville St. 8th Floor \nEast Wing Room 805", "city": "Toronto, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "M5S 1B2", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor50362", "organisation": "Women\u0092s College Hospital (Canada)", "website": "http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/", "sponsorType": "Hospital/treatment centre", "contactDetails": {"address": "76 Grenville Street", "city": "Toronto, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "M5S 1B2", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.417199.3", "rorId": "https://ror.org/03cw63y62"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder14215-0", "name": "Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (Canada) - http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca (ref: MCT-77376)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2011-03-09T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "21", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2005-07-08T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "95638385"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Randomised Controlled Trial of 6% Cellulose Sulfate (CF) Gel and the Effect on Vaginal Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Transmission", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "Effect on vaginal male-to-female transmission of HIV/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT).

A systematic literature review has found weak evidence that laxatives can improve stool frequency and consistency and can alleviate related symptoms in older people. Dietary and lifestyle interventions have also been shown to alleviate constipation. More generally, in studies aimed at the modification of individual health-related behaviour, brief interventions have been shown to have limited effect while intensive, patient-tailored interventions have been more effective though costly. The proposed study will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of brief and intensive lifestyle interventions with medical management in treating chronic constipation in older people. \n\nMain aims:\n1. To investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of laxatives versus dietary and lifestyle advice.\n2. To investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of brief, standardised versus personalised dietary and lifestyle advice. \n\nSecondary aims:\n1. To describe the adherence by patients to treatment protocols and to estimate its impact on cost-effectiveness.\n2. To describe the adherence by health care professionals to intervention protocols.\n\nMore information can be found at: http://www.hta.ac.uk/1310\nProtocol can be found at: http://www.hta.ac.uk/protocols/200100100004.pdf\n\nPlease note that, as of 17 January 2008, the start and anticipated end date of this trial have been updated from 1 October 2002 and 30 April 2006 to 1 June 2003 and 30 September 2008, respectively. \n\nPlease note that, as of 24/08/2009, the HTA reference number has been amended from HTA 10/01/04 to HTA 01/10/04.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Quality of life related to constipation.", "secondaryOutcome": "Frequency and severity of symptoms of constipation; subjective perceptions of whether constipated; satisfaction with bowel function; compliance with therapy; treatment side effects and adverse events; relapse and re-consultation rates.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN73881345", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "HTA 01/10/04"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Pragmatic cluster randomised trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "GP practice"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2008-09-30T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "77fb2eb7-ed30-4fe8-b48e-e102452ab618", "name": "Centre for Health Services Research,", "address": null, "city": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NE2 4AA"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "Older adults (aged 55 and over) with prevalent chronic constipation", "ageRange": "Senior", "gender": "Both", "targetEnrolment": "0", "totalFinalEnrolment": null, "totalTarget": "Added May 2008: 27 GP practices", "exclusion": "Added May 2008:\n1.
