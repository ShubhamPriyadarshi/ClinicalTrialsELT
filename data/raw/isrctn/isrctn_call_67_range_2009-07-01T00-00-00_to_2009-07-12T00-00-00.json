In order to start immune reactions in the CNS, myelin antigen needs to be presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) in conjunction with MHC class II molecules, and this antigen-MHC II complex needs to be recognised by a specific T cell receptor (TCR) of the anti-myelin T cells. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine inhibits interferon gamma-induced MHC class II antigen expression on astrocytes in vitro through \u00df2 adrenergic signal transduction mechanisms. We found that astrocytes in MS lack \u00df2 adrenergic receptors. We hypothesise that a loss of these receptors in MS facilitate the deviation of astrocytes to function as facultative immunocompetent antigen presenting cells. In support of this, we were able to demonstrate that reactive astrocytes in MS lesions express MHC class II and B7-costimulatory molecules, and are therefore equipped to promote APC-dependent T cell activation. \n\nCompounds that elevate cAMP in astrocytes may restore suppression of MHC class II molecules in astrocytes. We  investigated other aminergic receptors on astrocytes in MS and found some receptors that are also linked to the regulation of intracellular cAMP formation. An interesting candidate receptor is the 5-HT4 receptor. We intended to start a clinical study in patients in MS with the 5-HT4 agonist cisapride. However, we abandoned this project because of recent serious safety concerns with cisapride.\n\nAstrocytes also contain the 5-HT transporter. Drugs that block this transporter elevate endogenous serotonin concentrations, and it has been shown that serotonin also increases cAMP levels in cultured astrocytes. Fluoxetine is a prototype drug that can be used to achieve this goal. Fluoxetine is occasionally used in patients with MS who are depressed. One investigator (Traugott) noticed that patients using fluoxetine seemed to stabilize with respect to their MS-related symptoms. She also found a beneficial effect of fluoxetine in an animal model of MS, chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalitis. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effects of fluoxetine, a 5-HT transporter blocker, on disease activity in patients with MS.

The vaccines are given within the schedule of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) of 6, 10, and 14 weeks common in many developing countries. The proposed age for the first immunisation with PCV is 6 weeks of age, which has the highest coverage and best timeliness in most national programmes. Both PCV and PPS vaccines have been used as a booster following the primary series with PCV. The PPS vaccine with higher PS content (25 mcg vs. 2-10 mcg ) may induce higher GMCs than PCV vaccines, but the avidity of antibodies might be higher following a booster dose of PCV. The results of this study together with information on disease burden estimates and cost-effectiveness analyses could play an important part in the decision-making process or whether or not to include the PCV in the national immunization program. \n\nObjectives:\nThe primary objective of this study is to compare immune responses following the primary series of one or two doses of PCV to the reference group receiving three doses of PCV when measured at 18 weeks of age. \n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n1. To describe the peak antibody responses one month after 1, 2 or 3 doses of PCV in early infancy\n2. To compare the development of immunological memory by the 3 different immunisation schedules with PCV\n3. To assess the immune response to serotypes 1 and 5 present in the PPS but not in the PCV in infants receiving PPS at 9 months of age\n4. To describe persistence of serotype specific anti-pneumococcal PS antibodies following three different primary series schedules when measured at 9 months of age\n5. To confirm the functional activity of the elicited antibodies by evaluating the opsonophagocytic activity of the antibodies in a randomly selected sub-set of 30 serum samples taken at 18 weeks and 7 days after the vaccinations at 9 months in each of the four study arms\n6. To describe safety and tolerability of PCV administered according to the different immunisation schedules (combined active and passive surveillance)\n7.
