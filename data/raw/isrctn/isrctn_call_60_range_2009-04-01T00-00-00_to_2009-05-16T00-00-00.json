And for many unresectable HCC, transcatheter arterial chemoembolism (TACE) is the most effective way to relieve the disease and elongate life. However, some studies have revealed that TACE may reactivate HBV replication and result in worse prognosis in HCC patients. \n\nSome evidences show that interferon-alpha (IFN-a) can reduce HBV level effectively and safely. In addition, IFN-a has also been proved a worthful therapy to HBV-related HCC with postponed recurrence and prolonged life time. We assume that at the same time of TACE treatment, administration of IFN-a may suppress the reactivation of HBV replication. To test our assumption, we designed a randomised controlled study in HCC patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBS-Ag) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBe-Ag) to evaluate the efficacy of HBV inhibition and survival by double therapy with TACE and IFN-a versus monotherapy with TACE.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.

It aims to achieve change in societal norms within communities. The intervention has three components:\n1. The youth programme for in- and out-of-school youths, is delivered by carefully selected and trained Zimbabwean school leavers in the year between leaving school and starting university. These school leavers work as volunteers and go to live and work in the rural communities for 8 - 10 months of the year. They act both as role models for young people and as a bridge between adults and youths within communities. These professional peer educators (PPEs) use well-structured, theoretically based materials which they deliver in a highly participatory way. The programme is delivered to all students and out-of-school youths who wanted to take part and not just those enrolled in the trial cohort.\n2. The programme for parents and community stakeholders is a 22 session community-based programme that aims to improve knowledge about reproductive health, to improve communication between parents and their children and to improve community support for adolescent reproductive health. The community component arose from focus group discussions held with parents during the feasibility study. Parents lamented the collapse of traditional communication structures and acknowledged their lack of communication skills. Interestingly young people also said that they struggled to communicate with their parents especially about reproductive health issues and that they saw this as an important barrier to staying safe.\n3. The programme for nurses and other staff working in rural health clinics aims to improve accessibility of clinics for out-of-school youth.  \n\nThese three components are highly integrated. For example, nurses trained to run the clinic intervention also run sessions within the youth and parents programmes and in so doing publicise the accessibility of the clinic. PPEs help run the 'youth corners' at the clinics and help facilitate sessions in the parents programme. Integrating the three components in this way makes them mutually supportive and reinforcing. By living and working so closely with the community it is hypothesised that the PPEs are able to change the norms of that community through challenging the norms that may be detrimental to adolescent reproductive health and reinforcing those that are beneficial.\n\nNo specific intervention was introduced in the deferred intervention arm, but standard HIV prevention activities were implemented through the District AIDS Action Committees by local and international governmental and non-governmental organisations across both early and deferred intervention communities. The project provided voluntary HIV counselling and testing through rural health clinics in all 30 communities on one day a month for the duration of the study. Uptake and acceptability was recorded.\n\nThe intervention was introduced in 2003 in the early implementation arm and in 2007 in the delayed implementation arm. The intervention ran in the early implementation arm for four years from 2003 - 2007. The final evaluation survey was conducted in 2007 after 4 years of intervention delivery. The final evaluation survey was a representative population based survey of 18 - 22 year olds living in six purposively selected enumeration areas in the 30 study communities - i.e., 180 enumeration areas in all.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2008 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18778329 study design and baseline results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "aa12c77b-cdbe-403b-bc26-5cbf37756f63", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2008-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18778329"}, "description": "study design and baseline results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18639-0", "contactId": "Contact56631_18639", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55205"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56631_18639", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Frances", "surname": "Cowan", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research\nThe Mortimer Market Centre\nOff Capper Street", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "WC1E 6AU", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55205", "organisation": "University College London (UCL) (UK)", "website": "http://ucl.ac.uk", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Gower Street", "city": "London", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "WC1E 6JD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7380 9878"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "francesmcowan@yahoo.co.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.83440.3b", "rorId": "https://ror.org/02jx3x895"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder18639-0", "name": "National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) (USA) (ref: RO1 MH-65570-01 and RO1 MH-65570-4S)", "fundRef": "http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025"}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "20", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2009-05-11T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "68794421"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Impact of a psychological intervention in patients under assisted reproductive treatment (in vitro fertilisation [IVF]/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI])", "scientificTitle": "Impact of a psychological intervention in patients under assisted reproductive treatment (in vitro fertilisation [IVF]/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection [ICSI]): a prospective (longitudinal) blinded randomised experimental intervention study", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "1.

A problem-based learning perspective was established and the responsibility of planning and execution of the activities was shared between patients and the staff, consisting of a doctor, nurse, physiotherapists, dietician, and other important supporters. \n\nIn total, 114 full-time hours, focusing on food preferences, selections, physical exercise, and stress management were provided during the first four weeks. The activities were repeated during a four-day revisit to the centre 6 or 12 months after the program. The study tried to establish functioning groups as a source to achieve changes and as a start for individual targets. The main focus was to combat risk of future stroke and CVD. The refresher course was used for repetition and revision of the \"home program\".\n\nThe randomised study took advantage of a mismatch between demands and supply of the multidisciplinary programme. Referrals from the county accumulated during the 4 - 6 weeks preceding the admittance dates. Proper referrals were determined by the team doctor and the clinical team at the centre. During seven rounds of admission in 1988 - 1989, 325 patients were properly referred to the programme. They outnumbered the available places. It was not feasible, with available knowledge, to rank the needs for this treatment by the type of risk factor or by the risk factor levels. Instead patients were listed with identity numbers (not names or referral forms) and the list was sent to one researcher (Thomas Svensson) who allocated the cases using random numbers. When a patient allocated to treatment announced that he or she was prevented from coming, one more patient from the full list was randomised to be a case. Eventually 239 patients were randomly allocated to the programme, and 86 patients referred back to their doctor for usual care. \n\nSigns of myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are important to include in the study of risk factors for CVD. Other pathological features were also noted (particularly if they had changed during the study period). A previous MI was diagnosed when, at the beginning of the study, there were electrocardiogram (ECG) signs corresponding to the Minnesota Code criteria: 1:1-2, 5:1-2, and 1:3+5:3, MI (ECGsp), coded as 2, and if less specific ECG criteria were found corresponding to Minnesota code 1:3, 5:3, 6:1-4, 7:1-3, 8:0-9, and 9:1-8 MI (ECGnonsp) coded as 1.  \n\nThe occurrence of signs of a new MI during the study period, i.e, during a period of on average 5 years, as observed from the ECG recording at the end of the study, was diagnosed as a recent MI (ECGsp or ECGnonsp).\n\nChanges in ECG signs after (A) compared with before (B) the intervention were obtained by subtracting the code values (B - A), resulting in a scale with the steps -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. A negative value denotes diminishing and a positive value signs of a new or increasing signs of previous MI. \n\nLVH was diagnosed when there was a high amplitude QRS complex, Minnesota Code criteria 3:1 and 3:3, or in combination with typical ST and T changes as in Minnesota Code criteria 4:1-4.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable",

Non-inferiority is demonstrated if, within a 95% confidence interval, buprenorphine performs within a preset tolerance limit of clinically acceptable differences in outcomes, completion rates between the two treatments.\n\nIndividual ready for heroin detoxification were given information about the trial and invited to participate. Consenting participants were then randomised to one of the two treatments. Detoxification was undertaken in a specialist outpatient clinic according to pre-defined protocols. The detoxification procedure required that this was an open label trial. The primary outcome was whether or not an individual completed the detoxification. Completion of the planned detoxification was taken to be an objective marker of both the acceptability of the pharmacotherapy and also the effectiveness of the detoxification procedure in the clinic.

Glycaemic monitoring is required to attain this objective and current guidelines suggest that HbA1c levels below 7% should be achieved where possible. Although many people find that checking-blood glucose levels at home is a helpful way to undertake glycaemic monitoring, there is a need for more evidence to support its systematic use among people with type two diabetes. Previous trials have been small and have not incorporated a consistent approach to applying the results of tests to lifestyle. The aim of this open randomised controlled trial is to compare the use of blood glucose self monitoring to the standard practice of intermittent HbA1c checks in people managing their type two diabetes with diet or oral hypoglycaemic tablets. All patients will receive additional information about managing their diabetes. Patients randomised to blood glucose testing will be trained in the use of the blood glucose meters and given additional support to help them interpret the results in relation to the measures they are undertaking to improve HbA1c. \n\nThe main outcome is HbA1c levels in the different groups, with additional measurement of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, satisfaction with care, quality of life and costs of care. In addition to a direct comparison of the different groups, the study will inform routine clinical practice by an exploratory study of those people who might gain particular benefit from using different techniques to check glycaemic control and a series of in-depth interviews with study participants.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary outcome measure is HbA1c, while additional outcome measures include blood pressure, cholesterol, self-reported smoking status, frequency of hypoglycaemia, symptom severity, changes in oral hypoglycaemic medication, addition of insulin to medication regimens and changes in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction, Diabetes Self Care Activities and Well-being Questionnaire scales at one year.", "secondaryOutcome": "1.
