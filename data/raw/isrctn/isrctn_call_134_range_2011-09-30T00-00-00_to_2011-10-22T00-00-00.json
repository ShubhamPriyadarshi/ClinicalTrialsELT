The mechanisms of metformin action have yet to be fully elucidated, although recent data have implicated AMP-kinase activation as a potential mediator of metformin action in hepatocytes and skeletal myocytes. We propose to take this a step further. We will conduct a double-blind randomised glycaemia-controlled crossover study in 20 overweight type 2 diabetic patients comparing interventions of metformin with a sulphonylurea. In this group we will study resistance artery endothelial function ex vivo, based on the hypothesis that metformin will augment NO-dependent vasorelaxation. In addition, we will quantify AMPK activity in fat cell lysates from the same patients to clarify whether metformin regulates this kinase in adipocytes. Together, these data will increase our understanding of metformin's vascular action and may pave the way for novel therapeutic targeting of AMPK in the context of metabolic and vascular pathophysiology.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Measured at the end of each 10-week study phase:\n1.

Two alternative techniques may be used to obtain a bloodless field; deep hypothermic circulatory arrest  (DHCA) involves the draining of blood from the entire circulation into the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) reservoir for short periods of time and selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) maintains blood flow to the brain, but blood flow to the lungs is reduced allowing adequate vision for dissection.\n\nNull Hypothesis: \nThe two methods of obtaining a bloodless field for performing PEA are:\n1. Equivalent in maintaining brain function, and \n2. Equivalent in their surgical success, i.e. improvement in lung function\n\nAlternative hypothesis: Studies by Ergin et. al. in 1994 and 1999, where 19% and 28% of patients, respectively, undergoing DHCA showed temporary neuropsychological dysfunction. In comparison, Eusanio et. al. in 2002 showed a dysfunction in 5.1% of patients undergoing SACP. We therefore hypothesise that although surgical success will not differ between the two techniques, SACP will be superior to DHCA in maintaining (or improving) pre-operative brain function.\n\nPrevious hypothesis:\nTo determine whether maintaining blood flow around the brain during pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), as opposed to total circulatory arrest, improves three-month post-operative brain function.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The proportion of patients demonstrating a decline in cognitive function, compared to baseline, 12 weeks after PEA in DHCA versus SACP groups.

Patients will be randomly allocated into either DHCA or SACP groups.\n\nCognitive (or neuropsychological) testing will be used to assess subject brain function pre- and post-operatively (3 and 12 months). Cognitive testing aims to detect slight changes in intellectual function and personality, and has traditionally been done using 'pen and paper' tests. Consensus statements published in 1995 and 1997 recommend four tests (Rey auditory verbal learning test, Trail-making A and B, and the grooved pegboard) to be used as a minimum to enable comparisons to be made across different studies. Computerised tests may also be useful, as they are more user friendly for both test administrator and subject, and are less susceptible to human error. We therefore propose to administer the consensus battery of four conventional tests alongside a series of computerised tests (CAmbridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB]). The patient and member of the research team administering the cognitive function tests will be blind to the randomisation group. Scores for depression, anxiety and pain will be used to check for their effects on test results. The national adult reading test will also be administered to subjects in order to determine baseline intelligence quotient (IQ) levels. The total length of time spent by each subject on the cognitive testing will be 4.5 hours (1.5 hours at each of the pre-operative and follow-up visits). \n\nCognitive testing will be carried out in a dedicated quiet room (added as of 25/04/2008 - previously 'quiet area of the ward'), by the same test administrator on each occasion, without interruptions and allowing for rest breaks if required by the subject. Blood samples will be collected before the operation, and also at one time point post-operatively. These samples will be stored until an appropriate test for oxygen deprivation has been identified, up to a maximum of ten years (added as of 25/04/2008 - previously two years).\n\nAll patients return to Papworth Hospital for an inpatient stay of 2 - 4 days at 12 weeks and and a minimum of 1 day at 1 year post-operatively as part of their routine care (added as of 25/04/2008 - previously there was no mention of 'minimum of 1 day'). Lung function testing, six-minute walk test, New York Heart Association (NYHA) scores and the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) quality of life assessment (a disease specific questionnaire developed at Papworth Hospital) are routinely carried out during the 12 week and 1 year visits and this data will be collected. A right heart catheter is routinely performed at 12 weeks to measure changes in pulmonary artery pressures. These routine assessments will provide the measures of surgical success for our study. No additional clinical assessments will be carried out as part of the study.\n\nSafety and recourse use data will also be collected for each participant, including all adverse events, details on the operative procedure, concomitant medications, and length of critical care and hospital stay.\n\nProject timetable:\nMonths 0 - 2: trial literature will be produced and Ethics Committee approval will be sought\nMonths 3 - 32: recruitment of patients into the study. A total of 110 will be required. If 1 patient is recruited per week, for 48 weeks/year, recruitment will be complete in 27 months.\nMonths 6 - 44: follow-up period. Patients will be followed up for 1 year post-operatively.\nMonths 45 - 47: closedown period to ensure data complete and prepare final report.\n\nRisks and inconvenience for participants:\nThere are no additional risks involved with completing the cognitive tests. However, the additional time necessary to complete the tests may be considered an inconvenience by some participants.\n\nJoint Principal Investigator:\nDr Alain Vuylsteke\nDepartment of Anaesthesia\nPapworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust \nPapworth Everard \nCambridge CB23 8RE\nUnited Kingdom\nTel: +44 (0)1480 364675\nEmail: alain.vuylsteke@papworth.nhs.uk", "interventionType": "Procedure/Surgery", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22000135 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "29c65d49-20ee-4c4a-b064-908864a50489", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22000135"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder17136-0", "Funder17136-1", "Funder17136-2", "Funder17136-3", "Funder17136-4"], "contactId": "Contact55097_17136", "sponsorId": "Sponsor53662"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55097_17136", "title": "Mr", "forename": "David", "surname": "Jenkins", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery\nPapworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust\nPapworth Everard", "city": "Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB3 8RE", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)1480 364806"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "David.Jenkins@papworth.nhs.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor53662", "organisation": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (UK)", "website": "http://www.papworthhospital.nhs.uk/", "sponsorType": "Hospital/treatment centre", "contactDetails": {"address": "Papworth Everard", "city": "Cambridge", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB23 8RE", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "alain.vuylsteke@papworth.nhs.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.412939.4", "rorId": "https://ror.org/01qbebb31"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder17136-0", "name": "Cambridge Consortium -

Traditional Varicose vein surgery for the long saphenous system (LSV) consists of a high ligation, involving a cut in the groin and multiple avulsions, dealing with the varicosities in the legs. This requires general anaesthesia and is performed as a day case or inpatient treatment with one night in hospital. For patients, traditional surgery results in pain, extensive bruising, limited mobility and a delayed return to normal activity lasting up to six weeks, although more usually only two weeks. Surgery needs to be performed by surgeons who have achieved competence in the procedure. Recently, new methods for treating varicose veins have been introduced into the independent healthcare sector. These give patients a choice of procedures and some allow varicose veins to be treated without general anaesthesia. In addition, patients report less pain, bruising and an early return to normal activity. These new procedures are endoluminal thermal ablation (VNUS), endovenous laser therapy (EVLT), venocuff valve reinforcement and Varicofoam therapy. The NHS modernisation programme aims to increase the use of day case surgery, enhance patient choice , Increased day case activity in Nottingham can be performed in the new diagnostic and treatment centre (DTC). The aim of this study is to compare the latest treatments for varicose veins using established outcome assessments verified by previous studies performed in the department of vascular surgery at the QMC.\n\nStudy design:\nThe study comprises randomised study comparing different approaches to the treatment of long and short saphenous disease. Patients will be given a copy of the information sheet. They will be given time to consider their decision and when they wish to enter, they will be asked to sign the study consent form. A copy will be given to patient, one will be placed in their clinical notes and one will be kept in Mr Braithwaite's office at the QMC. Data will be recorded on an established venous database. In all of the component parts of the study, one leg will be chosen at random for the treatments that are to be compared. All patients will have pre-procedure duplex examination of their legs to confirm the anatomy of their varicose veins. The stage of Venous disease (CEAP classification) will be recorded. Before the selected treatment, digital photographs of the patients' legs will be taken according to our established methodology. Patients will be asked to complete visual analogue scales before the procedure to assess their perception of pain and bruising in their legs. For 10 days after the procedure, patients will be asked to keep a diary record of pain, bruising and activity. Between 5 and 10 days after the procedure, patients will be visited by a trained nurse who will note any complications and repeat the digital photographs. Patients will be seen between 6 weeks and 3 months post-operatively for a clinic review as is our normal practice. At this visit, photographs will be taken again to assess residual varicosities ( varicose veins not fully treated). Patients will be asked specific questions about the quality of their treatment and any complications (satisfaction, pain, numbness, infections, scarring). During the same time interval a duplex scan will be performed to objectively assess the completeness of treatment. As close to one year, two years and five years after treatment, patients will be asked to attend the vascular laboratory at QMC for clinical and duplex assessment. The study will be completed 1 year after final patient recruitment.\n\nOutcome assessment:\nThis study is based on within patient comparison and therefore each component requires only a few patients.

Primary analyses will be by intention-to treat. The level of significance will be set at p<0.05. The effect of the intervention on the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritic Index (WOMAC) functional score will be assessed, first, by investigating whether outcomes differ significantly overall by groups.\n\nThese analyses will be adjusted for baseline measures. The following additional analyses are planned. Two tests of interaction will be carried out to investigate whether the effect intervention is influenced by:\n1. Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression [HAD] score), or \n2. Self-efficacy (Arthritis Self-Efficacy Score)\n\nFor all outcomes, both unadjusted (adjusting only for the baseline measure) and adjusted analyses (adjusting for other potential confounding factors) will be carried out; the latter will be interpreted as 'sensitivity analyses' to explore the robustness of the unadjusted analyses to possible confounding. Finally, process variables characterising the success with which the intervention was delivered (e.g. compliance) will be included in analyses of WOMAC functional score only, in order to interpret better the overall effects of the intervention.\n\nEconomic evaluation: \nThe primary economic evaluation will be a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing changes in the primary outcome (WOMAC) and total societal costs for each group. The secondary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis based on utility weights associated with EuroQoL Health Survey (EQ-5D) health states. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be employed for both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses in order to better inform decisions about the relative cost-effectiveness of the three treatments. Supplementary evaluation will take the form of a cost-consequences analysis, examining total and component costs alongside all outcomes. \n\nThe data analyses would be conducted in a manner consistent with those employed in the clinical evaluation (for example, on an intention-to-treat basis, and adopting the same conventions with respect to cluster randomisation, missing items scores, missing observations etc.). Cost differences between groups will be tested using the student's t-test. Cost data are often skewed, violating the normality assumption underpinning the validity of the t-test. If this is the case, bootstrap replications of the original data will be performed to check the robustness of the t-test results. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to check the assumptions made in the cost calculations and analyses.

The treatment of gynaecological tumours is however recognised to present particular difficulties in relation to altered fertility, changes in body image and sexual dysfunction. There is evidence to indicate that improvements in sexual function and reduction in psychological morbidity in breast cancer patients can be achieved through counselling. Some previous studies evaluating sexual dysfunction in gynaecological oncology have been flawed due to the failure to use control subjects, the exclusion of partners or the limited duration of follow-up. The Northern Centre for Gynaecological Oncology provides the opportunity to conduct this study due to the centralisation of surgical treatment. The applicant also has the support and supervision of nursing, clinical psychology and medical colleagues, thus providing the skill range necessary to complete the project.\n\nAims :\n1.

with LTRAs against alternative treatments at steps two and three of the guidelines, comparing resource use over a two year period to the NHS and patients (on an intention to treat basis), using either a cost-minimisation or cost-effectiveness approach. The choice will depend on whether differences emerge between the groups over two years with particular emphasis on two months and two years (i.e. short and long-term).\n\nSECONDARY: To compare other clinically relevant asthma outcomes between two treatment groups at two months and throughout the two year study (see Primary outcomes).\n\nThe design enables this to be compared at step two with inhaled steroid prescription and at step three with add-on of a long-acting beta agonist prescription. Its pragmatic design coupled with clinical trial rigour:\n1. Concealed randomised allocation of patients,\n2.
