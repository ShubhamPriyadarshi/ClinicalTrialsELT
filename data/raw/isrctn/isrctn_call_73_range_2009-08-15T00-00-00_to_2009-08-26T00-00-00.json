Thus most potential WHIS_Epi participants have already been followed up since then (exception: new household members). Since the start of EMINI, participating households have been visited annually, in order to collect lab samples and interview data regarding HIV, malaria, tuberculosis (Tb) and other infectious diseases from all consenting household members. \n\nIn August 2008, examination for intestinal nematode infection and schistosomiasis (using Kato-Katz faecal thick smears and urine filtration) and standard helminth treatment was introduced in parts of the EMINI population. In accordance with national Tanzanian (TZ) guidelines treatment is 400 mg albendazole for participants older than 3 years and 200 mg albendazole for participants younger than 3 years from households where intestinal nematode infections were found, and 40 mg praziquantel per kg for individual treatment of diagnosed schistosomiasis infection. Due to logistic and financial constraints we were initially only able to offer these services to only half of the participating households. \n\nHowever, during the next round of follow-up starting 1st August 2009, all study participants will receive diagnosis for helminth infection and treatment if needed. The WHIS-Epi study will link data of previous helminth infection and respective treatment with data on HIV incidence and disease progression in both parts of the EMINI cohort.\n\nJoint/scientific contact details: \nDr Leonard Maboko\nManaging Director of MMRP\nMbeya Medical Research Programme\nMbeya\nTanzania", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder18878-0", "Funder18878-1"], "contactId": "Contact56871_18878", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55461"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56871_18878", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Elmar", "surname": "Saathoff", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Leopoldstr. 5", "city": "Munich", "country": "Germany", "zip": "80802", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+49 (0)89 2180 3830"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "elmarsaathoff@web.de"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor55461", "organisation": "Department for Infection and Tropical medicine (Abteilung fuer Infektions- und Tropenmedizin) (Germany)", "website": "http://www.tropinst.med.uni-muenchen.de", "sponsorType": "Hospital/treatment centre", "contactDetails": {"address": "Abteilung fuer Infektions- und Tropenmedizin\nLudwig-Maximilans-University (LMU) Munich University Hospital \nLeopoldstr. 5", "city": "Munich", "country": "Germany", "zip": "80802", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+49 (0)89 2180 3830"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "tropinst@lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.5252.0", "rorId": "https://ror.org/05591te55"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder18878-0", "name": "German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG]) (Germany) (ref: SA 1878/1-1)", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder18878-1", "name": "European Commission (Belgium) - DGVIII AIDCO (donor of EMINI) (ref: SANTE/2006/129-931)", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2009-08-19T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "19", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2009-08-19T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "93000276"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Mangosteen juice blend for the reduction of inflammation in obese subjects", "scientificTitle": "Mangosteen juice blend for the reduction of inflammation in obese subjects: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose finding study", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "The hypothesis of this study is that XanGo\u2122 Juice (a proprietary juice blend containing mangosteen juice) will reduce inflammation and increase antioxidant levels in obese subjects.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Efficacy of multiple doses of XanGo\u2122 Juice compared to placebo on inflammation as measured by levels of HS-CRP and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha).

Invasive treatment\n2. Continued medical  treatment\n\nInvasive treatment:\nPatients undergo coronary angiography as soon as possible after randomisation. Angiography can be performed at either the referring center or the intervention center. Coronary angiography is performed according to current practice guidelines by experienced operators. The sheath and catheter size should not exceed 6 F. \nAll patients follow the routine assessment in the regular heart team conferences, in which the referring cardiologist, the heart surgeon, and the intervention cardiologist take decisions about the type of revascularisation. The Dutch Guidelines for revascularisation are followed except for the required intensity of the anginal complaints.\nPTCA procedures are performed under routine protocols of the participating catheterisation laboratories. The aim is to treat all culprit lesions i.e. those lesions that are associated with significant deficits on the myocardial perfusion scintigram. All lesions are preferably treated with a paclitaxel-coated stent, unless contra-indicated or not available. Blood samples for the measurement of concentrations of CK and CK-MB are taken at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after the end of a percutaneous procedure. These concentrations are measured at the local laboratories. \nTreatment with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors is recommended. Clopidogrel is started before the PTCA and continued until at least 1 month after stenting and until 6 months after stenting when a drug-eluting stent is placed.\nBypass surgery is performed under the routine protocols of the participating hospitals. The aim is to achieve complete revascularisation.\nAfter a revascularisation procedure, the antianginal medication is reduced as much as possible.\n\nContinued medical treatment:\nAnti-anginal medication: Beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, oral nitrates may be given as clinically needed.\nAcetyl salicylic acid: Acetyl salicylic acid at a dose of at least 75 mg/24 hours is given to all patients at least until the end of follow-up (unless contraindicated).\nClopidogrel: Clopidogrel is given to patients that undergo a percutaneous intervention in combination with stent placement. Clopidogrel is given at a starting dose of 300 mg immediately before stent placement, followed by 75 mg daily for 3 months. Moreover, clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg/24 hours may also be given to patients with a contra-indication for acetyl salicylic acid.\nStatins: Aggressive lipid lowering therapy should be started in all patients as soon as possible after informed consent has been obtained.

The 4 layer bandage (4LB) is used widely in the UK but is discarded after a single use and is relatively expensive. The short-stretch bandage (SSB) id the standard bandage in Europe, and is reusable. A recent systematic review demonstrated the paucity of RCTs in this area, and those that exist are of poor quality. The review also showed that multilayer bandaging is more effective than single layer; high compression systems such as the 4LB and SSB are more effective than low compression systems; however the two trials that have compared SSB and 4LB were vastly underpowered and did not incorporate an economic analysis. This study proposes to compare the 4LB and SSB systems in a two-arm pragmatic RCT involving 400 patients with venous ulcers. Patients will be followed up until healing or for a maximum period of 30 months. \nSubstantial benefits to the NHS and patients will occur if the trial demonstrated one of the bandages is superior to the other; substantial resource savings would occur in bandage expenditure if it were shown that the SSB was of at least equivalent effectiveness to the 4LB.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Proportion of ulcers completely healed; healing rates; costs; quality of life; recurrence rates at 12 months.", "secondaryOutcome": "Not provided at time of registration", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN06644918", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "HTA 96/12/26"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Not Specified"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "1998-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2002-01-31T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "637cf50a-5b01-4709-8ea5-d016003528c0", "name": "Department of Health Sciences", "address": null, "city": "York", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "YO10 5DD"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "Patients with leg ulcers", "ageRange": "Adult", "gender": "Both", "targetEnrolment": "400", "totalFinalEnrolment": null, "totalTarget": "400", "exclusion": "Not provided at time of registration", "patientInfoSheet": null, "recruitmentStart": "1998-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "recruitmentEnd": "2002-01-31T00:00:00.000Z", "recruitmentStatusOverride": null}, "conditions": {"condition": {"description": "Varicose veins/ulcers", "diseaseClass1": "Circulatory System", "diseaseClass2": "Varicose veins of lower extremities"}}, "interventions": {"intervention": {"description": "1. 4 layer bandage\n2.
