The cementless short stem implant is made of a titanium forged alloy and has a proximal rough titanium micro-porous coating. An additional 20 \u00b5m dicalciumphosphate layer is applied electrochemically. The stem is anchored metaphyseally within the closed ring of the femoral neck. The Bicontact stem is designed for proximal fixation and load transfer to bone. According to the implant design and the Plasmapore-coated proximal part the secondary implant stability is achieved by proximal anchoring and cancellous bone ingrowth. Pre-operatively, 1 week after surgery, 6 month and 12 month after implantation the patients were examined clinically (Harris Hip Score) and underwent DXA examinations.\n\nAll patients underwent full weight bearing post-operatively. DXA scans were performed using a HOLOGIC Discovery A S/N 80600 device (Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA). The BMD (g/cm2) of the operated hip was measured using the \"metal-removal hip\" scanning mode. Conventional Gruen's zones were adapted to the short stem design. Each patient\u0092s individual ROIs were saved on the Hologic system and were used for all following measurements to reduce bias. The images were analyzed using the dedicated Windows analysis software (version 11.2). The patients were placed in supine position with the affected leg in 20\u00b0 internal rotation. The foot was secured in the Hologic foot positioning device in order to obtain reproducible rotation in all patients to limit measurement errors, since it has been demonstrated that rotation influences the BMD. \n\nDXA precision was assessed on all subjects. The patients underwent sequential DXA examinations of the contralateral unoperated hip and the proximal femur - taken preoperatively and one week later. Additional quality controls were done every morning for the DXA equipment according to the manufacturer's guidelines, to verify the stability of the system, and did not show any shift or drift during the entire study period. The device used in our study was therefore chaacterised as stable. The same observer (ML) analysed all DXA examinations. A Student's t-test was used to test the hypothesis of a difference between the means at the different measurement time points in the Harris hip Score as a normal distribution was ascertained. The Shapiro-Wilk-tests did not show a normal distribution in the DXA measurements, the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to statistically compare the density changes over one year. A p<0.005 was considered significant. Data analysis was performed with SPSS (11.05 SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois).

The study\u0092s second hypothesis was that motivation would predict therapeutic success.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The diagnosis interview:\nThe Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV-Child Version and Parent version (ADIS-C and ADIS-P). To assess the presence of spider phobia and comorbid disorders, the participants and their parents took part in separate semi-structured interviews aimed at detecting anxiety disorders in the children. Studies conducted on these instruments suggest a high inter-rater reliability (r = 0.98 for interviews with parents and r = 0.93 for interviews with children 18 and high test-retest reliability (k = 0.76 for interviews with parents).\n\nQuestionnaires and behavioural measure:\nThe first four instruments deal with motivation, interest, and participant's perception of the therapy program. The last two measures of motivation were designed for the current study and administered beforehand to an independent sample of 31 school-aged children to ensure they understood the items. \n\nMeasures of motivation and interest toward treatment:\n1. \"Why are you in therapy?\" Questionnaire for children. This is the target measure of motivation, the main variable in this study. It assesses the type of motivation shown by patients in therapy, as defined by Deci and Ryan. To shorten the questionnaire from 24 to 17 items, we retained only the two items with the highest saturation on each subscale. The rating ranges from 1 to 5 on a Likert-type scale ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"Absolutely\". Participants had to fill out the questionnaire at pre-treatment (T1), post-phase one (T4) and post-treatment (T5). \n2. The Treatment Appeal Questionnaire was composed of a single item asking to what extent the child would have preferred to receive the other form of therapy (e.g., in virtuo for those in the in vivo condition). Responses ranged from 1 to 5 on a Likert-type scale describing the degree to which the child agreed with the statement. The measure was taken at pre-treatment (T1), at the information session (T2) and during each of the sessions of the first phase of the exposure program (T3).  \n3. The Treatment-related Discomfort Questionnaire consisted of four items designed to assess signs of reluctance to come to therapy. The parents had to indicate to what extent they were in agreement with the statements describing their child emotions and behaviours before coming to each therapy session in the two phases of the treatment program (T3 and T5). The choices of responses were from 1 to 7, on a Likert-type scale ranging from \"Does not correspond at all\" to \"Corresponds completely\" and were averaged to produce the final score.   \n\nMeasures of treatment outcome:\n4. A shortened version of the Spider Beliefs Questionnaire was used. The 23 items with the strongest loadings on both subscales (beliefs about spiders and beliefs about oneself in presence of a spider) were retained. The measure was administered at pre-treatment (T1), post-phase one (T4), post-treatment (T5) and at the six-month follow-up (T6).  \n5. The Spider Phobia Questionnaire for Children (SPQ-C) was administered at pre-treatment (T1), after phase one of the treatment (T4), at the end of the treatment program (T5) and at the six-month follow-up (T6). The instrument contains 29 items that measure the severity of fear of spiders and avoidance behaviors using a dichotomous true-false format. \n6. The Behavioural Approach Test (BAT). This test was adapted from a study by Lavy and collegues and provides an objective of phobic avoidance. The BAT was administered at pre-treatment (T1), post-phase one (T4) and post-treatment (T5). A live tarantula was put in a closed vivarium (completely hidden under a cardboard box) on a motorised platform placed on a table, 173 cm from the participant. The child could move the vivarium closer in by pushing a button at his/her own pace. The BAT score varied from 0 (refuse to perform the test) to 10 (the strongest approach behaviour), and the last step the child was able to complete provides the score. The child sat at the end of the motorised platform and the researcher lifted the cardboard box (Step 1). Then the lid of the vivarium was removed (Step 2). Note that the tarantula could effectively get out once the lid was removed (the children were aware of this). After looking at the tarantula for 1 minute, the child pressed on a button that slowly moved the open vivarium closer on the motorised platform (Steps 3 to 9 consisted of each time the child moved the platform 25 cm closer). Once the vivarium was within 23 cm of the child, he/she had to lean forward over the opening of the vivarium and look at the tarantula for 1 minute (Step 10). During the BAT, participants were allowed to take short breaks and stop the platform, but any pause longer than 25 seconds was considered a complete stop. The whole procedure was explained to the children before they began the test.\n\nMeasurement times are indicated as follows: \nT1 = pre-treatment\nT2 = information session\nT3 = mean of the scores collected weekly during the first phase of the treatment\nT4 = post phase one\nT5 = post-treatment\nT6 = follow-up", "secondaryOutcome": "Measures relating to use of the virtual reality:\nThe following three ancillary measures were administered to describe the sample using questionnaires that are important to measure in VR studies:\n1. The Immersion Tendencies Questionnaire was administered at pre-treatment (T1) in order to describe the sample and the extent to which the child could easily feel immersed in the virtual environment. It consists of 34 questions on a 7-point Likert-type scale (from 1 - never to 7 - often).\n2. The 19-item Child Presence Questionnaire measured the extent of the child's feeling of being there in the virtual environment, a variable considered a prerequisite to emotionally react when immersed in a virtual environment.\n3. The 11-item Cybersickness Questionnaire measured the extent to which the children were affected by side effects induced by their immersion in virtual reality (nausea, eye fatigue, dizziness, etc.) and was administered after each therapy session in virtual reality (mean of the scores collected during the first phase of the treatment, T3).\n\nResults regarding these instruments revealed that the immersive tendency and feeling of presence were adequate and little cybersickness was reported.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Ethics approval received from the Comite d'Ethique a la Recherche de l'Universite du Quebec en Outaouais on the 11th March 2004 (ref: 281)."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN87716831", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N/A"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Interventional randomised, single-centre trial with no masking performed.", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Quality of life"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2004-09-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2007-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Canada"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "863313af-6cdb-4c62-b45f-468857c6bb11", "name": "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais", "address": null, "city": "Gatineau", "state": null, "country": "Canada", "zip": "J8X 3X7"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.

During the interview at the clinic, the parents and children were given the specifics of how the child's treatment would be conducted. They then completed a battery of questionnaires. The behavioural avoidance test (BAT) was given before the questionnaires to avoid administering tests to a non-phobic child.\n\nTreatment:\n1. Information session on specific phobia and the rationale behind the treatment - \nUsing a cognitive-behavioural approach, the therapist explained what is a specific phobia and how it is treated. Information given to the children was adapted to their age group. They received a booklet containing illustrations and exercises that explained the rationale behind the therapy. At the end of the session, the children in the combined in virtuo and in vivo exposure group were introduced to the VR system. \n\n2. First phase of the exposure program -\nThe first phase of the exposure program consisted of four sessions of in virtuo or in vivo exposure, depending on the participants' condition assignment:\n2.1. In virtuo exposure:\nTherapy consisted of four 60-minute sessions over four weeks. The participants had to gradually approach virtual spiders (of various sizes and quantity) until their anxiety diminished. The virtual environment consisted of two apartments composed of a bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom, in which spiders were inserted. \n2.2. In vivo exposure:\nIn vivo therapy was also provided in four 60-minute sessions The in vivo participants were confronted gradually at their own pace, starting with pictures of spiders, various plastic spiders and up to a live tarantula (Grammostola Rosea, 14 cm long). Like in the in virtuo condition, the discomfort brought on by anxiety was verbally checked every five minutes throughout the session. \n\n3. Second phase of the exposure program -\nThe second phase of the exposure program consisted of one in vivo exposure session for all participants \nThe participants were exposed to the same live tarantula as the one in the behavioural avoidance test (Grammostola Rosea, 14 cm long).

Root caries develops in older adults as the gingival tissues recede to expose the root surface and bacteria accumulate as the gingival margin. The measurement of root caries is difficult due to the high organic content of the root dentine, the proximity of the lesion to the gingival margin and the difficulty in gaining access to the disease in patients who may be frail and elderly or who give only limited co-operation with the treatment. The development of novel anti-microbial treatment regimens, in combination with conventional topical fluoride, may enable the development of new management protocols for the treatment of existing root carious lesions and for the prevention of new lesions.\n\nWe propose to determine, in a double-blind placebo controlled trial, the effects of a antimicrobial varnish containing chlorhexidine and thymol in conjunction with a remineralising, fluoride-containing varnish on clinical and microbiological parameters of root carious lesions. The control procedure will consist of the fluoride varnish and a placebo varnish in place of the chlorhexidine-thymol varnish.
