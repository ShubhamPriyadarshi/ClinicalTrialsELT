Phe is toxic to the central nervous system, therefore an accumulation of Phe leads to an alteration in the psychomotor development. A strict diet can control the Phe blood level enough to avoid most of the serious neurological effects. However, dietary treatment presents some problems, such as difficult adherence, negative impact on the daily life of the patients or nutritional deficiencies. Sapropterin significantly reduces and maintains blood Phe concentrations with the subsequently improving quality of diet.\n\nSapropterin allows to partially or fully liberalize the diet with limited intake of phenylalanine in certain types of hyperphenylalaninemias. This will improve the quality of life of patients, as well as their neurological / cognitive development.

The STAT-PALM guidelines and training program will be developed through a review and modification of the proven PALSA-PLUS guidelines in light of Malawian national guidelines, and through consultations with the Ministry of Health, Malawian nurses and clinical officers, the Medical Council of Malawi and the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Malawi regarding content and accreditation of the training, drafting of the content, review of the content by stakeholders, and graphic design of the clinical tools (desktop maps and flipcharts) and training materials. Relevant Malawian national guidelines have been collected, and our guideline developers have been adapting and drafting specific guideline pages. These are then subjected to review in Malawi, and circulated to the appropriate Department Heads within the MoH for review and comments (e.g., National tuberculosis unit, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] Unit, Malaria Unit, etc) as well as frontline clinicians/specialists in the district or region. The reviewers are expected to check that the content is correct and appropriate, and to check that the algorithms flow properly and reflect available drugs/resources in Malawian Health Center settings. These comments are then transcribed and clarified if needed and discussed, then incorporated into the next draft of the guidelines, which are then returned to the same partners for review until they are accurately completed. Once the flow, content and materials have been completed, the various senior Malawi MOH Unit and Department personnel will sign off and approve them, then they will be sent to be printed and bound. \n\nTraining follows the proven innovative and evidence-based model of PALSA-PLUS, called educational outreach, a form of point-of-care training that provides case-based, onsite, training in clinical settings where primary care providers work. Trainers will be front-line healthcare workers from the MoH and other partners including the Christian Hospital Association of Malawi (CHAM) and other NGOs who will be trained to provide outreach training and support to their fellow front-line healthcare workers during focused (1 - 2 hours), intermittent, interactive sessions. A Master Trainer, already trained by the Knowledge Translation Unit (KTU) Team in Cape Town, South Africa, will be responsible for training all facility trainers. Curriculum development will also be informed by a training needs assessment during the curriculum design process. The initial facility trainer training is conducted offsite during the one week intensive course, during which the facility trainers are equipped with the necessary content, and their training skills developed and evaluated using an iterative process of training and feedback. In order to minimise travel between remote health centres, 12 facility trainers will be trained, and will conduct an average of 16 training sessions (one per health centre) each week. At health centres, integration of antiretroviral treatment (ART) into primary healthcare services will be facilitated through the training of all, rather than selected, healthcare workers at each health centre. A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 training sessions will occur at each health centre, over a maximum period of 16 weeks. Point-of-care guideline tools will be developed and distributed (e.g., a thin [approximately 30 pages] sturdy laminated ring binder containing the entire guideline, colourful and easy to follow algorithms designed to be on the primary care provider's desktop during each patient encounter, desk blotters with key STAT-PALM messages, laminated cards with key guideline messages on lanyards to be worn around the provider's neck). Ongoing routine training conducted by the DHO will continue in both intervention and control health centres. \n\nThe STAT-PALM training differs significantly from the current healthcare worker training in Malawi and elsewhere, which are usually didactic, taught by experts (rather than peers), and where HCWs are removed from their clinical setting for days to weeks at a time and compensated with per diems. The Master Trainer will conduct a follow-up visit with facility trainers and their trainees to assess progress and uptake. On a quarterly basis, facility trainers will meet with the Master Trainer and a high-level core trainer from Dignitas and/or the KTU to review progress, discuss challenges to implementation, and share experiences with a view to improving the quality of the trainings and subsequent versions of the guidelines. The guidelines distribution and training will occur at intervention sites only. No active distribution of the STAT-PALM materials or training sessions will occur in control facilities, however routine ongoing health centre supervision by DHO personnel and off-site DHO training courses will continue in all sites.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2010 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129211 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "ee40fad5-d78a-4f45-b2d0-0a72a760d6cb", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2010-12-03T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21129211"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder19461-0", "contactId": "Contact57461_19461", "sponsorId": "Sponsor56054"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact57461_19461", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Michael", "surname": "Schull", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "G-147, 2075 Bayview Ave", "city": "Toronto, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "M4N 3M5", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+1 416 480 6100 ext. 3793"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "mjs@ices.on.ca"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor56054", "organisation": "International Development Research Center (IDRC) (Canada)", "website": "http://www.idrc.ca/ghri/", "sponsorType": "Research organisation", "contactDetails": {"address": "Global Health Research Initiative\n150 Kent Street\nPO Box/CP 8500", "city": "Ottawa, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "K1G 3H9", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+1 613 696 2618"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "rgeneau@idrc.ca"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.419341.a", "rorId": "https://ror.org/0445x0472"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder19461-0", "name": "Global Health Research Initiative (Canada) -

These preparations guarantee an optimal energy supply and prevent deficiency in essential fatty acids. These fatty acids can alter pulmonary gas exchange due to their potentially proinflammatory properties. Several studies suggest that lipid emulsions effects on pulmonary gas exchange could be mediated by arachidonic acid derivates, especially eicosanoids.\n\nLinoleic acid is the precursor, through the arachidonic acid pathway, of series 2 and 4 eicosanoids. These molecules are mediators of inflammation with intense biological activity. A variety of studies show that eicosanoids have different effects on the lungs, acting on immune response, vasomotor tone, and/or inflammatory response.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 series (omega-3), which are derived from alpha-linolenic acid, as well as their derivatives eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are also precursors of biologically active substances, e.g. the series 3 and 5 eicosanoids. These molecules use the same metabolic routes and compete for the same elongases and desaturases as linoleic and arachidonic, but ultimately they are mediators that have a much less active biological profile than linoleic acid derivatives. Due to the different composition in fatty acids of diversal lipid emulsions, its endovenous administration could have different physiologic and pharmacologic effects beside energetic properties in high risk patients.\n\nIn this study we will try to evaluate the effect and security of a lipid emulsion enriched with omega 3 fatty acids, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Unfortunately, loco-regional recurrence and/or metastatic disease develop in the majority of patients who undergo pancreatic resection. Most patients typically relapse within 9 - 15 months from initial presentation and have median life expectancies of only 12 - 15 months without adjuvant therapy. The 5-year survival of patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma is approximately 10% for patients without adjuvant therapy.\n\nIn this clinical trial a de-escalation of CapRI-regime (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, interferon alpha-2b [INTRON A\u00ae] and external beam radiation) is investigated. We hypothesise that removal of cisplatin and radiotherapy will have no significant effect or only a minor impact on the clinical response but result in lower toxicity.\n\nPlease note that this is a follow-up study to a previously registered trial (see ISRCTN62866759 - http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN62866759).\n\nPlease also note that as of 02/10/2008 the initial inclusion and exclusion criteria of this trial were updated with the approval of the national competent authority.

The lung ventilation will be pressure controlled to reach a tidal volume between 6-8 mL/kg.  No changes in the ventilator setting will be made during the study period.  All patients will be requiring continuous infusions of a vasopressor agent (norepinephrine).

This catheter allows additional measurement of cardiac output by transpulmonary thermodilution and of derived variables including intrathoracic blood volume index, continuous cardiac output by pulse-contour analysis and SVV.  All transducers will be positioned at the mid-axillary line and zeroed to atmospheric pressure.  Patient consent or relative's assent will be sought.  Following initial resuscitation period and during period of haemodynamic stability patients will be initially monitored for 15 minutes to establish baseline values.  \n\nSubsequently all eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive either 4mls/kg of HyperHAES or Rescueflow over 5 minutes under continuous monitoring of cardiac filling pressures.  The fluid bolus will be administered via distal lumen of the CVP catheter.  The allocation to fluid group will be done by a non-participating pharmacist who will also hold the randomisation key.  Volume resuscitation is indicated if SVV% >15% but ITBVI < 1200 mls/m2.  250 mls fluid bolus will be given over 5 mins.  No changes in vasopressor therapy during period of measurement.  Ventilator settings will not be altered.  Any established continuous infusion of maintenance fluid or feed will continue at same set rate throughout study period.  Standard biometric data will be collected for each patient along with data to calculate the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score.  Type and rate of inotropic infusions will also be documented.  If clinical situation demands a non-participating clinician is able to withdraw patients at any time during the 2 hour study period.

This will include 3 days of lactulose (a stool softener) prior to the operation, and a discharge pack of lactulose, metronidazole (an antibiotic which has been found to help with pain relief after such operations), diltiazem cream (which relaxes the sphincter, relieving post operative pain) and diclofenac (a painkiller).  This is the standard regime for all patients having haemorrhoid surgery. After the operation, patients will be given a diagram of the positions of the removed haemorrhoids.  They will be asked to rank the wounds in order of painfulness at the end of each day.  They will also be asked to complete daily pain scores on a 10cm visual analogue scale, recording both experienced and expected pain.  The day of the first post operative bowel action will also be recorded, as well as pain scores for this and subsequent bowel actions.
