Patients received either 2 infusions each containing 200 mg iron [III]-hydroxide sucrose (Venofer\u00ae) or 2 infusions of 200 ml 0.9% saline (placebo) administered over a minimum period of 10 minutes each week for the first two weeks of the trial.  Each patient received a total of 4 infusions representing a total of 800 mg of iron in the Venofer\u00ae treated group.  Patients were followed for total period of 3 months.\n\nAdded 24/05/10:\nStatistical methods: \nFor description of the distribution medians and range were used. For analysis of differences of distribution of investigated parameters between Venofer and placebo groups, a non parametric test (Mann- Whitney U-Test) was used. Both types of analyses were performed, because deviations from normal distribution were found for primary objective variables, most items are categorically scaled parameters.\n\nStudy Results:\n1. Efficacy: \nDifference from baseline in median Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score between the treatment groups was not statistically significant but suggest a trend toward a greater improvement in patients treated with iron sucrose (difference in change BFI: -0.44, p=0.076). There was a significantly (p=0.036) greater improvement in categorized tBFI scores from baseline to Day 42 in patients treated with IV iron sucrose compared to patients treated with placebo There were significant differences between the study groups in some sub-group analyses.  Among patients presenting with severe iron deficiency at baseline (defined as TSAT below 20% and serum ferritin below 50 ng/mL or serum ferritin below 15 ng/mL) there was a significantly greater improvement in BFI score at Day 42, in patients treated with IV iron sucrose compared to patients treated with placebo (p=0.026).\nThere was a significant correlation between the change in fatigue from baseline to Day 42 as measured by the BFI and the change in fatigue as measured by Short Performance Inventory (SPI), a global investigator assessment (r=0.59, p<0.0001).\nPatients treated with IV iron sucrose showed a significant increase in serum-ferritin values during the study compared to baseline, and this increase was significantly greater in the IV iron sucrose group compared to the placebo group  (p<0.0001). \nThe results of this study suggest a clinical benefit for patients treated with iron sucrose and warrant further investigation in this area.\n\n2. Safety:\nIn total, 54 of 89 enrolled patients reported at least one adverse effect (AE) during the clinical study; most of the AEs were mild and unrelated to study medication. Two serious AEs (SAEs) were reported, one in each treatment group. There was one case of appendicitis and one serious traffic accident. Both were unrelated to treatment. Further, there were no clinically relevant abnormal findings in vital signs, physical exams or evaluation of concomitant medication during the study. This suggests that the iron sucrose treatment caused no safety concerns.  It can be concluded that the incidence of AEs following iron sucrose administration is low and reflects the safety profile labelled in the SmPC.", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Iron [III]-hydroxide sucrose (Venofer\u00ae)"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705493 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "d0d9f412-a4ad-4bfa-bb83-c78db3055115", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-09-22T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21705493"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder19485-0", "contactId": "Contact57485_19485", "sponsorId": "Sponsor56078"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact57485_19485", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Christian", "surname": "Breymann", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Gynakologie Geburtshilfe Seefeld\nSeefeldstrasse\n214", "city": "Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "zip": "CH-8008", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+41 (0)43 818 59 68"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "breymann@ggs-zh.ch"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor56078", "organisation": "Vifor Pharma, Vifor (International) Ltd (Switzerland)", "website": "http://www.viforpharma.com", "sponsorType": "Industry", "contactDetails": {"address": "Flughofstrasse 61", "city": "Glattbrugg", "country": "Switzerland", "zip": "CH-8152", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+41 (0)58 851 80 00"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "clive.burge@viforpharma.com"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.467607.4", "rorId": "https://ror.org/0185z7g17"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder19485-0", "name": "Vifor Pharma, Vifor (International) Ltd.
