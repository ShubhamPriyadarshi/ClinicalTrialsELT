To date, there is scarce data concerning early response assessment in metastastic colorectal cancer under treatment with cetuximab. In order to achieve more information about the early changes in both tumour glucose metabolism and tumour vascularisation and to evaluate its prognostic relevance for early clinical response, we aim to strictly monitor the effects of cetuximab on both parameters during a short-term single agent therapy with cetuximab. The achieved information may be helpful to early identify those subgroups of wild-type KRAS patients who respond to treatment with cetuximab.

Associations between depression and cognitive processes - thoughts, beliefs and attitudes that induce and maintain depression\n\nThe first two meetings are held within one week of each other, and the third one after one month. Patients will be provided with a self-help manual for overcoming depressive disturbances, based on the \"Coping with depression\" course by P.M. Lewinshon (see below for reference). For this study purpose, the programme has been partially modified and adjusted to specific emotional problems related to diabetes. Besides general information (prevalence and cause of depression, interaction with diabetes, treatment modalities, prevention of relapse), exercises to recognise and modify cognitive patterns that contribute to depression maintenance are included. \n\nA run-in period aimed at assessing patients' knowledge and diabetes self-care-related skills will precede the intervention. \n\nThe patients in the control group will be given feedback about the severity of their depressive symptoms and receive counselling about appropriate forms of treatment.\n\nRef: Lewinshon PM, Antonnucio DO, Steinmetz JL et al.

The demand for diagnostic endoscopy continues to increase and currently costs the NHS more than 100 million per year. The procedure also causes the patient significant discomfort and inconvenience. \n\nStudies in our own unit and other centres suggests that non-invasive Helicobacter pylori testing might replace endoscopy in determining the management of a substantial proportion of patients with simple dyspepsia. In order to asses this we propose a randomised controlled trial comparing endoscopy versus non-invasive H.pylori testing in patients with dyspepsia who are less than 55 years and have no sinister symptoms. The study will also allow identification of the patients who will benefit most from the non-endoscopic management. The ability to replace endoscopy by non-invasive test should result in major savings to the health budget and save the patient the discomfort of invasive procedure.

The sample was drawn from patients presenting at the Accident and emergency Department with an acute knee injury. All study patients received an MRI scan, but initial diagnosis was made without access to the scan or the radiologist\u0092s report.

For each area of the knee, the level of agreement (measured using weighted kappa) between the responses of the eight radiologists and the reference standard diagnosis was assessed.\n\nInvestigation of preferences:\nThe investigation of potential patient preferences for the diagnostic/therapeutic impact of MRI was explored using a discrete choice conjoint measurement research design.

Evidence of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PAFC (to help finalise the design of the RCT)\n2 Evidence on the indications for PAFC (to help finalise any exclusion criteria and to help inform the risk stratification criteria for the RCT)\n3.

To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PAFC in intensive care patients, including high risk surgical patients, as currently used in the NHS\n2. To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PAFC in high risk patients\n3. To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PAFC \"skill of use\". \nSetting: Adult general ICUs in the UK \nHealth Technologies Being Assessed: PAFC, as per objectives. \nProject Timetable: Months 1-12: Systematic review/preparation for RCT/ethical approval \nMonths 13-24: Recruitment/data validation/follow-up \nMonths 25-36: Follow-up/data analysis/writing up/dissemination \nSample Size: The most recent and most generalisable information available for sample size calculation derive from adult, general intensive care unit in Scotland in 1995/6. This indicated that 19% of patients received PAFC and that hospital mortality in this group was 52% as compared with 23% for patients without PAFC. To answer the hypotheses with sufficient power (90% power, p<0.05) and assuming 90% compliance, an estimate of X patients per group is required. \nRecruitment Rate: It is hoped that most ICUs (n=132) participating in the national, comparative audit of patient outcome, co-ordinated by ICNARC (over 50% in England and Wales), will participate in the RCT. Average annual throughput in an average sized intensive care unit is 300 admissions per year of which 57 (19%) are estimated to receive PAFC, 6954 admissions annually in recruited units to the national audit.\nEvaluation of risk adjustment: Due to the ethical problems of randomising patients to intensive care or not, the evaluation of the \"package\" of care is reliant on methods of risk adjustment. Five such methods are employed as part of the Case Mix Programme. The ability of these methods to mirror the results of the proposed RCT will be evaluated.

The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that problem-solving by trained CPNs is no more effective for anxiety, depression and life difficulties than usual GP care.
