In North America, there are over 450,000 people requiring dialysis, 80 - 90% of whom undergo haemodialysis (HD). Once on HD, a reliable conduit between the patient's blood circulation and the dialysis machine is required via a vascular access (VA). The vascular accesses have limited longevity, and patients often require multiple accesses during their lifetime on dialysis, averaging 2.77 accesses per patient. \n\nCurrently, all national HD guidelines recommend the initial creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), at the most distal site possible, (e.g. radiocephalic or forearm site) in order to preserve more proximal sites for later VA creation when the original forearm access eventually fails. However, the optimal secondary HD vascular access following the initial failed forearm access is unknown, yet is critical in order to continue receiving life-sustaining haemodialysis therapy. A trial is needed to help define the balance between access complications, interventions to manage them and related patient morbidities in order to determine the \"next best access\". \n\nThis current protocol is a pilot study for a larger study of the same design. \n\nAs of 12/03/2010 this record was updated to include further details on the Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded pilot study (an extension of the pilot study registered here).

Improved supportive care can importantly further reduce mortality; a series from a well equipped intensive care unit in Paris showed a mortality of 11% in patients with severe malaria. Supportive treatments include highly technical aids like renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation, but also easier to achieve treatments like enteral feeding. \n\nIn the well equipped intensive care setting early start of enteral feeding in a wide variety of patients, including those with sepsis, is now common practice. Nutrition supplies vital cell substrates, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, essential for normal cell function. Studies have shown that early enteral feeding preserves the barrier function of the gut, has positive effects on immune functions, is associated with a decrease in hypermetabolism and organ failure, and reduces the chance of bacteraemia. In severe malaria, patients are often poorly nourished and hypoglycaemia is a common complication, especially in patients receiving quinine. Also, bacteraemia with Salmonella species is more common in severe malaria, associated with increased bacterial translocation in the gut. Enteral feeding might have a beneficial effect here. \n\nThe downside of starting enteral feeding in the dependent comatose patient is the risk of aspiration pneumonia; this risk is also present in the mechanically ventilated patient, although the risk is lower with the use of post-pyloric enteral feeding tubes. A supine position of the patient is a risk factor. Routine endotracheal intubation to protect the airway in comatose malaria patients is not a feasible option in most of the tropical countries where malaria is endemic. The use of enteral feeding through a naso-gastric (NG) tube might thus induce a much higher risk of aspiration pneumonia, outweighing the theoretical benefits. \n\nAt Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH), the current practice is to start early enteral feeding through a NG-tube, with a volume of 2 - 4 ml/kg per feed every two hours, avoiding two late night feeds, resulting in a total of 10 feeds per day (for adults); in case of children daily fluid supplementation are as such from aged 2 - 4 years 100 - 120 ml/kg, 4 - 8 years 90 - 100 ml/kg, 8 - 12 years 70 - 90 ml/kg and greater than or equal to 12 years 60 - 70 ml/kg. Enteral feeding consists of a mix of blended local food. The energy content will be approximately 1 kcal/ml. Although not formally assessed, aspiration pneumonia is a rather common complication of NG feeding in CMCH. Factors that can contribute include the supine position of the patient and no check for gastric retention before the next feeding. We therefore propose a randomised trial to compare the start of early versus late nasogastric tube feeding, with aspiration pneumonia, incidence of hypoglycaemia and coma recovery times as primary outcome measures.\n\nPlease note that as of 29/07/2010 this record has been updated with the following status change: \"Based on the recommendation of our Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, the trial was stopped because of high incidence of aspiration pneumonia on 02/09/2009\".

Some radial operators routinely use different spasmolytic cocktail prior to transradial procedures with no studies so far convincingly supporting this action. \n\nSeveral different post procedure haemostatic techniques have been used ranging from tourniquets, compression devices and hydrophilic wound dressings. Various haemostatic compression devices specific to radial artery are marketed and Radistop [RADI Medical Systems B] and TR Band [Terumo] are widely used. There are no comparative studies done between these compression devices on outcomes and patient tolerance.\nRecently there have been reports of sterile inflammatory abscesses with the usage of sheaths with hydrophilic coatings. These inflammatory reactions are reported in 2-3% of cases [39-41].\n\nThe ramifications of radial artery occlusion and injury are important not only in patients undergoing repeat interventional procedures, but also in patients in whom the radial artery may be used as a conduit for coronary artery bypass surgery or in patients needing arterio venous fistula for haemodialysis. Radial artery spasm is a common morbidity which can cause considerable discomfort to the patient and can prevent successful completion of procedure.

The non-intervention group is included to provide information on the background progression or regression of heart failure without weight loss and in the situation where it is not possible to provide a placebo weight loss diet. Patients will be informed that they may be randomised to this control group and will not be receiving a therapeutic intervention. Since the study is designed to assess the benefit (or harm) of weight loss, it is ethically appropriate for such a non-intervention control group. Since it seems unlikely that there will be significant changes in cardiac function in the non-intervention group over the study period of 16 weeks, randomisation will be 3:1.\n\nThe main study has been powered on the basis of published data. The power calculations are estimated on the basis of the difference in peak vO2 measurements. Assuming a peak oxygen utilisation (VO2) during exercise of 19 (SD 3.9) ml/kg/min 24 subjects will be required to detect a 10% improvement in peak VO2 after weight loss with a p value of <0.05, power 85%). A pilot study in 6 patients (non-randomised, and receiving the intensive diet intervention) will be undertaken before the main study and will be used to provide information to confirm (or alter) the power calculations.\n\nObese patients with heart failure will be recruited from the cardiology clinic at Addenbrooke\u0092s hospital. Subjects will be given information leaflets about the study so that they can read and discuss them at home prior to giving consent at a later date (>48 hours). After an initial screening visit, at which patients will give informed consent, measurements will be made of peak VO2, blood parameters, and heart function. Based on these results, patients will be informed whether or not they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they do, at the subsequent visit (measurement baseline) they will be randomised to the active intervention or control group. They will be randomised to either intensive dietary intervention (intervention group) or observation (control group).  Both groups will therefore attend one screening visit, and 3 measurement visits (week 0, 6 and 16). The active intervention group will also attend for weekly and then two-weekly interim visits so that their diet can be monitored and managed. The control group will make only one interim visit at week 10.\n\nSubjects will attend the Clinical Research Facility (CRF) at Addenbrooke\u0092s Hospital Centre for Clinical Investigation (ACCI) at 9am on the study day. Subjects will stay overnight (i.e. for 36 hours) and all measurements listed will be performed during the stay in the CRF. These are: peak VO2 during supervised exercise on a treadmill, measurements of left ventricular function by either echocardiography or MRI, heart rate variability using standard electronic recording devices, body composition using standard techniques, plasma BNP levels and other blood measures, quality of life measurement by standard questionnaire, and spontaneous physical activity using a commercially available recording device.\n\nA low calorie liquid diet will be provided to the intervention group. This dietary regimen is routinely used to achieve initial weight loss by specialists at weight loss management clinics worldwide and also in the Obesity Clinic at Addenbrooke\u0092s Hospital. Patients will continue this diet for 6 weeks with regular weekly interim follow up. This will be followed by weight loss maintenance diet, the energy value of which will be calculated from standard equation relating height, weight and age to basal metabolic rate.\n\nThis study design will allow us to separate effects from acute weight loss and a stable lowered body weight.\n\nThe study has been designed with consultation and involvement of experts in obesity, cardiology, and nutrition. The diet intervention is informed by many years experience, including patient feedback and audit, from the setting of an NHS obesity clinic and other clinical trials.

local newspapers in Cambridge and invitation letters to local people chosen at random using random addresses generated using the wild-card function of the BT 0n-line directory.  This technique has previously been used by the author in respect to the surveys quoted earlier.  Respondents will be asked to telephone the principle investigator with a contact telephone number or address. The attitudes to mental illness questionnaire will then be sent to interested parties along with an information sheet.  People who return the completed questionnaire will then be telephoned and an interview arranged a few weeks later either at Mill House, the subject's home or another safe location convenient to both parties. Whenever possible two subjects will be chosen from each household.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to starting the interview.  The interview will involve a short series of questions and will last around 10 minutes.  These questions are based in the principles of motivational interviewing.  This technique has been widely shown to be effective in producing changes in behaviour and attitudes in addicted people including smokers, alcoholics and heroin addicts.  It has also been used to increase compliance with antihypertensive medication in non-addicted people.  A series of questions has been devised such as \"What are the major problems preventing rehabilitation of heroin addicts in treatment\", \"What can society can to encourage heroin addicts to return to paid employment?\" \"How do you think housing problems can prevent people recovering from heroin addiction\".  The process of considering these questions is thought to produce changes in people's outlook and attitudes rather than the precise answers that are given.  Subjects will not be given any specific information in answer to these questions unless they ask the investigator. Two versions of the interview will be used.  One relating to heroin addiction, the other to diabetes.  This will generate an experimental group and a control group (who were interviewed using the same questions adapted for diabetes).  As far as possible motivational questions will be interchangeable between heroin addiction and diabetes. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either interview using a block randomisation technique performed by a third party (Dr Luty's staff grade at the Taylor Centre).  Subjects will be randomised several days prior to the interview.  When two subjects are recruited from the same household then each will receive a different interview in order to act as paired controls.  At the end of the interview subjects will be asked to complete two versions of the attitude to mental illness questionnaire - one in respect to a hypothetical heroin addict and the other to a hypothetical diabetic).  Diabetes was chosen as sufferers also inject drugs.  However the validation study  for the attitudes to mental illness questionnaire show people have a much more positive attitude to them than heroin addicts.   The Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire has recently been validated by the principle investigator in a large sample of the UK general public and is reliable and simple to administer.  The self-completion questionnaire contains a short vignette describing a hypothetic patient.  This is followed by 5 short questions to which the subject is asked to choose answers (e.g. John has been injecting heroin daily for 1 year - 1.  Do you think that this would damage John's career?  Strongly agree/Agree/Neutral/Disagree/Strongly disagree/Don't know).  The questionnaire produces scores from -10 to +10.  The responses from the above survey of over 800 people gave a mean score of -5.38 standard error 0.53) for a hypothetical heroin addict and 5.82 (standard error 0.11) for a hypothetical diabetic.  A follow up will take place at 3 months with subjects being posted the questionnaire and asked to complete the questionnaire once again.  Subjects will be contacted with a follow-up questionnaire once again.  Subjects will be contacted with a follow-up telephone call for those who fail to respond.  Subjects will be paid \u00a315 each for time and inconvenience and to cover any travelling expenses.  In the event that interviews are conducted off Hospital sites the location of the interview and contact details will be logged with the Principle Investigator's base as per the Lone Working Policy.  The Methadone Alliance has been consulted in regard to the above project.

There is extensive research evidence available of pharmacological pain relief during labour; however this evidence is not readily available to pregnant women. Decision aids are tools that present evidence based information and allow preference elicitation.\nWe developed a decision aid for labour analgesia for primiparous women planning a vaginal delivery. The aim of the decision aid was to reduce decisional conflict (uncertainty regarding which option to use), increase labour analgesia knowledge, without increasing anxiety and increase satisfaction with decision making in regards to labour analgesia. We tested the effectiveness of the decision aid in a randomised controlled trial.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Decisional conflict (uncertainty about which preference to choose) will be assessed by the Decisional Conflict Scale which has established reliability, good psychometric properties and is short (16 items). It has been used to evaluate a range of decision aids .\n2. Measures of knowledge and realistic expectations about labour analgesia options and the benefits and risks of these options will be specific to this project. Thus we will need to develop, and test these measures as part of the project.\n3. Anxiety will be measured by the state component of the short Spielberger anxiety scale which has been extensively used and validated [30,32]. We do not anticipate the decision aid will increase women's anxiety but it is important to document any changes in anxiety associated with the decision aid.\n4. Satisfaction with analgesia decisions will be assessed using the Satisfaction with Decision Scale - a very brief six item scale with high reliability was developed specifically to assess satisfaction with health care decisions\n\n\nSatisfaction with the decision and anxiety will be measured again at 12\u009616 weeks postpartum. This interval was chosen to avoid the potential bias arising from questioning women still in the hospital who may feel a disloyalty to their caregivers by a critical appraisal and whose opinions have been shown to be more positive and short-lived than those obtained further out from the birth itself [34]. At that time we will also ask about exposure to the decision aid (to assess contamination), support during labour and use of pain relief methods prior to hospital admission. These issues will be further explored in the sample selected for in-depth interview.", "secondaryOutcome": "Service utilisation outcomes: \nThe aim of the decision aid is to assist preference elicitation, and not to influence the direction of the decisions taken. Nevertheless, it is important to collect service utilisation and pregnancy outcome data so we will record and compare the pain relief methods used by women in all arms of the study, as well as recording and comparing rates of pregnancy complications and perinatal outcomes. The latter will be obtained (with informed consent) from the existing computerised obstetric database and include: \n1. Medical or obstetric complications\n2. Induction or augmentation of labour\n3.

The exercise regime consists of 12 x 30 minutes supervised exercise sessions, two a week for 6 weeks. The classes will be closely supervised by the applicant or research assistant, and performed on individual patients or in groups of eight patients who will rotate around exercise stations and will involve:\n\n1. 24 isometric quadriceps: Maximal Voluntary Contractions (MVCs) will be performed with the patients seated and their knees flexed at 90\u00b0F as described in the quadriceps strength assessment. The MVCs will be performed in four groups of six MVCs, each contraction will be maintained for about 4 seconds and each group of six contractions separated by 1 minute rest to minimise fatigue. Vigorous verbal encouragement and visual feedback from the computer screen will facilitate maximum effort. All the contractions will be voluntary, no electrical stimulation will be used.\n2. Five minute on a static exercise bike: Initially the patients will pedal without resistance, but after two to three sessions resistance to pedalling will be increased to increase quadriceps strength.\n3. One minute of isotonic knee extension (concentric quadriceps contractions) and flexion (eccentric quadriceps contractions) to 90\u00b0F, using therapeutic resistance bands to increase quadriceps strength and dynamic control.\n4. Three 'functional' exercises (eg sit/stand, step-ups, step-downs) and three balance/co-ordination exercises (unilateral stance, balance boards) will each be performed for one minute. As the quantity and quality of the exercises improve they will be progressed by increasing the number of repetitions or resistance (e.g. sit/stand from lower chair, step-ups on to higher block) and more challenging exercises were introduced (e.g. unilateral stance on balance board).\n\nSelf-care advice:\nAll patients attending the exercise sessions (whether treated individually or in small groups) will receive arthritis self-care advice emphasising: the importance of regular controlled exercise; methods of controlling joint pain, eg cold and heat packs; joint protection; medication; problem solving and planning to promote adoption of lifestyle changes to promote joint health, ie the importance of weight loss, incorporation of regular exercise into daily routine. This will be provided by the research worker supervising the exercise, who will answer specific questions, and will be reinforced with written information.\n\nDischarge policy: \nAfter 12 rehabilitation exercise sessions (the primary outcome measure end-point) the patients will be discharged with specific advice and written instructions to perform a simple, home exercise programme consisting of four exercises they are familiar with performing during their rehabilitation. The total exercising time will be about 15 min, three times a week. In addition, they will be supplied with contact addresses where the patients can exercise in the community.\n\nChanges in the intervention group will be compared with changes in the control patients who remain under routine GP management.\n\nData Analysis Plan:\nCluster randomisation requires that analyses take into account clustering, if the individual patient is chosen as the unit of analysis (which maximises power); this is most effectively done by multilevel modelling (level 1 = participants; level 2 = GP surgeries).  Cluster randomisation is less likely than individual randomisation to achieve adequate balance in patient and cluster characteristics, and multilevel modelling also allows such potential confounding factors to be modelled.\n\nOutcomes are measured at baseline, at 6 weeks (ie end of the intervention or control period) and 6 months after the end of the intervention.  These \u0091repeated measures\u0092 will be represented as a further level of clustering (measurements within participants) in a multilevel model.  Multilevel modelling accommodates missing data for repeated measures efficiently, maximising the power of the analyses and the available information about outcome. The analytic framework of multilevel modelling can be extended to binary variables.\n\nOutcome measures at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up assessment will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics.  Primary analyses will be by intention-to treat. The level of significance will be set at P<0.05.  The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome [function-WOMAC(func)] will be assessed, first, by investigating whether outcomes differ significantly overall by groups and, second, by carrying out paired comparisons between (a) the individually treated patients and control group and (b) patients treated in classes and control group if overall significant differences by group are observed. These analyses will be adjusted for baseline measures.  No test of the interaction between time of outcome measurement and intervention group is planned.\n\nThe following additional analyses are planned.  Two tests of interaction will be carried out to investigate whether the effect of intervention is influenced by (a) depression  or (b) self-efficacy.  For all outcomes, both unadjusted (adjusting only for the baseline measure) and adjusted analyses (adjusting for other potential confounding factors) will be carried out; the latter will be interpreted as \u0091sensitivity analyses\u0092 to explore the robustness of the unadjusted analyses to possible confounding.  Finally, process variables characterising the success with which the intervention was delivered (eg compliance) will be included in analyses of WOMAC(func) only, in order to interpret better the overall effects of the intervention.\n\nEconomic evaluation: \nThe primary economic evaluation will be a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing changes in the primary outcome [WOMAC(func)] and total societal costs for each group. The secondary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis based on utility weights associated with EuroQol health states. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be employed for both the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses in order to better inform decisions about the relative cost-effectiveness of the three treatments.\n\nSupplementary evaluation will take the form of a cost-consequences analysis, examining total and component costs alongside all outcomes.\n\nThe data analyses would be conducted in a manner consistent with those employed in the clinical evaluation (for example, on an intention-to-treat basis, and adopting the same conventions with respect to cluster randomisation, missing items scores, missing observations etc.). Cost differences between groups will be tested using the Student's t-test. Cost data are often skewed, violating the normality assumption underpinning the validity of the t-test. If this is the case, bootstrap replications of the original data will be performed to check the robustness of the t-test results. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to check the assumptions made in the cost calculations and analyses.\n\nIn addition, the EuroQoL will enable calculation of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for the interventions.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2007 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907147 main results\n2007 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907207 results of economic evaluation\n2010 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20149236 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "true", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": [{"@id": "d473e2e7-bbad-40cb-821e-59fac785d88b", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2007-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907147"}, "description": "main results", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "27382b85-95e4-4615-9b76-14ee27305077", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2007-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17907207"}, "description": "results of economic evaluation", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "c6b757c4-99bc-4937-a045-3d181f5cabb5", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20149236"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}]}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder1402-0", "contactId": "Contact5154_1402", "sponsorId": "Sponsor52177"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact5154_1402", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Mike", "surname": "Hurley", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Physiotherapy Division \nKing's College London\nRehabilitation Research Unit\nKing's Healthcare (Dulwich)\nEast Dulwich Grove", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SE22 8PT", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7346  6022"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "mike.hurley@kcl.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor52177", "organisation": "Arthritis Research Campaign (UK)", "website": null, "sponsorType": "Charity", "contactDetails": {"address": "Copeman House\nSt Mary's Court\nSt Mary's Gate", "city": "Chesterfield", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "S41 7TD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)1246 558033"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "info@arc.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.507369.e", "rorId": "https://ror.org/02jkpm469"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder1402-0", "name": "Arthritis Research UK (UK) - (previously Arthritis Research Campaign [ARC])", "fundRef": "http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000341"}}]}}
