To compare the reduction in mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) as recorded by ambulatory home BP (A&D Medical Blood Pressure Monitor with Bluetooth\u00ae)\n2. To compare the change in fasting glucose levels (LifeScan OneTouch Ultra II Blood Glucose Monitor + Polymap Bluetooth\u00ae Adaptor for the OneTouch Ultra II), and HbA1c levels\n3. To compare the change in triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) levels\n4. To compare the reduction in mean SBP and DBP, as recorded by clinic BP using BpTRU\u2122\n5. To compare the reduction in waist circumference and weight\n6. To compare the improvement in mean steps per day using an Omron\u00ae pedometer\n7. To compare the change in resting heart rate and heart rate variability over 24 hours\n8. To compare the change in stage of change for physical activity (Prochaska and DiClemente's \"Stage of Change\" model)\n9. To compare the change in predicted maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) using the STEP\u2122 test\n10. To compare the change in quality of life (using 36-item short form health survey [SF-36], version 2)\n11. To compare the change in vascular geometry and elastic properties of the carotid, aorta and femoral arteries\n12. To compare the change in muscle sympathetic nerve activity discharge patterns and how this relates to peripheral (i.e., forearm) and systemic vascular resistance\n13. To compare the change in C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, catecholamines, vasopressin, plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, oestrogen, progesterone, cortisol, creatinine, microalbumin, homocysteine, heat shock proteins, adiponectin, and leptin\n14. To compare the change in 3D ultrasound and cardiac function (echocardiography; including systolic function, diastolic function, ejection fraction, left ventricular wall dimensions and volume and stroke volume)\n15. To compare the change in self efficacy (measured by diabetes and physical activity scales)\n\nPhase 1 and 2 exercise intervention groups will then be compared at all timepoints (weeks 12, 24, 52). Because exercise interventions have appreciable attrition rates of up to 50% at six months; we will assess both intervention groups again at 6 months post study to determine decay effects.\n\nHypotheses:\nNull hypotheses:\n1. Improved exercise behaviours in either phase 1 or 2 will not enhance primary, secondary or tertiary outcomes\n2. There will be more change of primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes in institutional versus community settings (phase 1 versus 2)\n\nAlternative hypotheses:\n1. Improved exercise behaviours in either phase 1 or 2 will enhance primary, secondary or tertiary outcomes\n2. There will be equivalent change in primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes in phase 1 and 2 settings\n3. The model of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor diminution in metabolic syndrome described herein will be effectively deployed using a translational research approach using allied health care provider prescription", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Clinical blood pressure, recorded using a programmable automated device (BP-TRU\u2122 100 model, Vancouver, BC)\n2. Blood glucose, lipid profiles, CRP and markers of RAS function: fasting blood glucose will be measured in the institutional setting using laboratory assays. In the rural setting, patients will use a remote monitoring glucometer (Bluetooth\u00ae enabled) as well as scheduled laboratory assays. Lipid profiles and CRP will be assessed using laboratory assays. Plasma catecholamines will be assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography whereas vasopressin, angiotensin and cortisol will be determined by radioimmunoassay approaches. \n3. Predicted V02 max: subjects will perform a modified self-selected STEP\u2122 test. Based on values of subject's height, weight, resting heart rate, training heart rate, and performance on the STEP\u2122 test, V02 max values will be calculated.\n4. Body composition, body mass index (BMI - kg/m^2), waist circumference\n\nAll measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.", "secondaryOutcome": "1. 3D ultrasound measurement of carotid artery: patients will undergo a 3D ultrasound exam to assess the extent of their carotid atheromatous disease\n2. Behavioural measures: surveys to examine changes in behaviour change with exercise interventions and quality of life, i.e., stage of change, self efficacy, decisional balance, SF-36\n3. Physiological measures: \n3.1. Cardiac function: standard echocardiographic approaches using B-mode and M-mode echo Doppler imaging will be performed by a certified echocardiographic technologist. Image location and gain settings will be adjusted to yield optimal definition of endocardial and epicardial borders. Chamber and wall dimensions will be measured according to the standard methods of the American Society of Echocardiography and left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening will be calculated from the difference between systolic and diastolic cavity dimensions over 3 cardiac cycles at end diastole taken at the QRS peak. LVM will be calculated according to the method of Devereux et. al. and normalised to body surface area (BSA). Left ventricular diastolic filling will be assessed in the left lateral decubitus position (supine) or sitting (upright) and data manually traced and digitised from 5 cardiac cycles in each subject. Pulsed Doppler transmitral flow velocities will be taken from the apical 4-chamber view between the tips of the mitral valve leaflets. Doppler data will be manually traced and digitised in each subject. Measures of peak early flow velocity (E), atrial flow velocity (A), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and early deceleration time (DT) will be recorded at a sweep speed of 50 or 100mm/s. Intimal-media thickness of the right common carotid artery will be assessed with longitudinal B-mode images of the carotid artery in the patient's supine position with the head turned 45 degrees away from the side examined at a straight portion of the artery 1 - 2 cm proximal to the bifurcation.\n3.2. Vascular properties: major conduit vessels will be examined because these provide the major buffering capacity for systolic pressure and they provide enhanced spatial resolution for analysis. Using B-mode echo Doppler imaging and the EchoPak software in the GE/Vingmed Ultrasound machines (System FiVe and Vivid I) we will measure the wall thickness (anterior and posterior wall) and cross-sectional diameter of each arterial segment at systole and again at end diastole. Electrocardiogram (ECG) markers will provide cues about the cardiac cycle phase. Measures of all variables will be made from three separate cardiac cycles in carotid, femoral and aortic vessels taken at end expiration. This procedure should take approximately 45 minutes, which includes setup time and verification of the data.\n3.3. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity: microneurographic sympathetic activation will be obtained from the common peroneal nerve. A 200 \u00b5m-diameter, 35 mm long tungsten microelectrode that tapered to an uninsulated 1- to 5-\u00b5m tip is inserted transcutaneously into the perineal nerve just posterior to the fibular head. A reference electrode is positioned subcutaneously 1 - 3 cm from the recording site. Neuronal activity is amplified 1,000 times by a pre-amplifier and 50 - 100 times by a variable gain isolated amplifier. The signal is band-pass filtered with a bandwidth of 700 - 2,000 Hz and then rectified and integrated to obtain a mean voltage neurogram (0.1 sec time constant). A muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) site is confirmed by the characteristic pulse-synchronous burst pattern that does not produce skin paresthesias and that increases in frequency during a voluntary apnea but not during arousal to a loud noise.\n3.4. Lower body negative pressure: the participant's lower body will be sealed inside an air-tight box at the hips. A small vacuum can be created in this box that mimics the effect of postural changes on the cardiovascular system. Levels of suction up to -40 mmHg will be used; this simulates levels of cardiovascular stress that are equivalent to the seated position.\n3.5. Cardiovascular reactivity: the Stroop Test - subjects are asked to identify the colour of the text ignoring the semantic meaning of the word. Presentation of slide rate is increased over time to create an increasing stress level. Blood pressure, heart rate and MSNA will be measured as indices of the stress response.\n3.6. Forearm endothelial function: using B-mode echo Doppler ultrasound we will make continuous measures of brachial artery diameters for 3 minutes following the release of a 5 - 10 minute period of forearm circulatory occlusion. This test is used as an index of endothelial function as the brachial artery dilation is related to shear stress. To test the effect of endothelial dysfunction the test will also be performed before and after the sublingual administration of 0.4 mg nitroglycerine. The nitroglycerine acts as a nitric oxide donor and will enhance both diameter and compliance responses under conditions where inadequate endothelial-derived nitric oxide is produced.\n3.7. Continuous blood pressure: a finger cuff device (Finometer) will be used to measure blood pressure continuously. Similarly, a pulse oximeter will be placed around a toe in order to detect flow oscillations at that site. The finger cuff may feel a little tight and the finger may turn blue while in operation. However, these sensations go away immediately when the machine is turned off.\n\nAll measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.", "trialWebsite": "http://dual.ca/artemis/index.html", "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "The University of Western Ontario Research Ethics Board for Health Sciences Involving Human Subjects (HSREB) approved on the 10th March 2009 (ref: 15828)"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN50086114", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "CCT-83029"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2009-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2012-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Canada"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "8780185a-ca62-491a-abb7-953337878892", "name": "Aging, Rehabilitation & Geriatric Care Research Centre", "address": null, "city": "London", "state": null, "country": "Canada", "zip": "N6C 5J1"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.

Currently, core decompression combined with implantation of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells appears to be an effective treatment against this disease in the early stage. Among the bone morrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are crucial to the efficacy. The number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the bone marrow mononuclear cells is very limited, which are crucial to the efficacy of the treatment. Therefore, the aim of our trial is to obtain greater number of bone marrow MSCs through culturing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and transplant these cultured bone marrow MSCs into the affected femoral head following the procedure of core decompression. In our procedure, about two million cultured bone marrow MSCs could be implanted into the femoral head, compared with that about 20 - 25 thousand MSCs implanted into the femoral head in the procedure employed by other groups, therefore, we expect our procedure could lead to higher clinical and radiographic success rate and better clinical outcome.\n\nProcedure:\n1. Isolate mesenchymal stem cells from the autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells\n2. The patients are treated with core decompression\n3. The cultured stem cells are injected into the femoral head\n\nThe duration of our treatment is about 2 weeks. Bone marrow aspiration is performed in the same day of the surgery core decompression, then autologous bone marrow-derived and cultured mesenchymal stem cells are transplanted into the femoral head two weeks post-operatively.\n\nThe patient enrolment period was designed from 04 March 2004 to 01 September 2011.

The trial will also provide robust evidence on whether this dementia adviser model facilitates earlier diagnosis for people with dementia and improved access to services. These are key measures that have a long-term impact on the quality of life for a person with dementia. The third element of this trial will be to provide evidence of the financial impact of the Dementia Adviser programme for the NHS, social services and society. These findings will be vital in influencing changes in policy and practice relating to services for people with dementia.\n\nIn order to meet the above detailed objectives a parallel group, randomised, pragmatic cluster trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the dementia advisor program in comparison to information provision alone. Twenty sites throughout England will be randomised to either receive the Dementia Advisor Service or to receive information provision alone. Consecutive people with dementia referred to each site will be invited to participate in the clinical trial until 35 participants have been enrolled into the study at that site. It is anticipated that it will take 3 - 4 months to recruit the 35 participants at each individual site.\n\nParticipating sites will be randomised by the trial statistics team.

In addition to thrombolysis, aspirin is the only proved effective agent for patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, the net benefit of aspirin is small. There is therefore a medical need to ensure a better protection against the early recurrence or deterioration of ischemic stroke.\n \nClopidogrel is superior to aspirin for second prevention for ischemic stroke, and pharmacokinetic data showed that conventional regimen of clopidogrel administration (75 mg/d) need 7 days to reach the optimal platelet inhibition effect, while 300 mg loading dose regimen, i.e. 300 mg initiation followed by 75 mg/d can reach the maximum platelet inhibition effect within 3 hours. Our pilot trial demonstrated a clear benefit trend of loading dose clopidogrel (300 mg) better than daily 75 mg of clopidogrel in patients with acute cerebral infarction/TIA.

Five minutes prior to removal, and immediately following removal, patients will record their pain scores on a standard 10cm visual analogue scale (an unmarked line), with the 2 ends to signify no pain and the most severe pain imaginable. Patients will mark the same line for both the left and right sides of the nose, and label each mark accordingly.

The pain is thought to be due to forces applied to the teeth during tooth movement with orthodontic fixed appliances or \"braces\". Pain experienced is unpredictable and usually peaks at 48 to 72 hours after the brace has been adjusted. Not all patients complete their orthodontic treatment because of the pain experienced at the start of treatment. An alternative type of fixed orthodontic bracket has been designed which the manufacturers claim is less painful to the patient during treatment. However, there is no independent evidence to support this finding. The  \nbracket passively holds the orthodontic wire in position and is said to reduce friction. The standard orthodontic bracket holds the wire in position using small elastic bands which impart more friction, therefore more force is needed to overcome the friction and move the tooth. \nThe aim  of this study is to establish whether the new type of orthodontic bracket results in less pain for the patient.

Many leg ulcers contain slough and necrotic tissue and, whilst removal of these tissues (debridement) is widely thought to contribute to healing, direct evidence is lacking. Larval therapy has been proposed as a quick and effective debridement strategy and is increasingly used in the NHS, mainly by nurses. Larval therapy may achieve debridement more swiftly than modern wound dressings, which promote a moist environment aiding self debridement, and, unlike surgical debridement, larval therapy use is not reliant on highly trained personnel or the fitness of the patient for surgery. A further benefit of larval therapy, namely the removal of wound bacteria and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureas (MRSA) in particular, has been suggested, but robust evidence of this is also required. This study will establish the cost-effectiveness of larval therapy in the healing of venous and mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers; it will also assess the impact of larval therapy on wound microbiology, including MRSA, and the acceptability of the treatment for patients.\n\nPlease note that, as of 16 January 2008, the anticipated end date of this trial has been updated from 30 June 2007 to 30 April 2008.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Added 10/07/08:\nTime to healing of reference ulcer", "secondaryOutcome": "Added 10/07/08:\n1.

Recent evidence suggests this is associated with an increased mortality and poor long-term outcome. However, the studies done so far have used early parenteral feeding to improve outcome. Parenteral feeding is itself a relatively high risk and high cost procedure. We propose to test the efficacy of early jejunal enteral feeding versus standard gastric enteral feeding in a prospective randomised controlled trial in patients with severe head injury, requiring mechanical ventilation. Retrospective analysis would specifically control for disease severity (Glasgow Coma Scale and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II) as well as other demographic and clinical parameters measured during the study. The aim is to determine the degree of clinical and functional benefit accruing from early enteral feeding (if any) and to differentiate possible sub-populations that most benefit from such treatment.
