The FSS questionnaires contains nine statements that rate the severity of the subject's fatigue symptoms an a scale from 1 to 7.

Timepoints of assessment: baseline, 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year. \n4. Sleep quality, measured by polysomnography (PSG), including transcutaneous PCO2. At baseline, PSG will be performed in spontaneous breathing in order to characterise the abnormal respiratory events associated with COPD and identify obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Sleep and respiratory events will be recorded and scored manually according to standard criteria. REM hypoventilation will be scored when a progressive oxygen desaturation is associated with a sustained reduction in both flow and thoracic components of ventilation. During the same period, a constant or reduced respiratory drive (assessed by a reduction in respiratory effort as demonstrated by pulse transit time) should be observed without characteristic apnoeic or hypopnoeic episodes.

This test consists of a 40 minutes sleep-resistance challenge conducted in a dark and quiet room. The subject will be asked to remain awake while reacting to a visual stimulus, which appears for 1 second every 3 seconds, by hitting a button. Sleep latency will be defined as the delay between the onset of the test and the moment corresponding to seven consecutive flashes (i.e. 21 seconds) without response. Fluctuations in vigilance and micro-sleep episodes will be quantified as the number of occasions that 3 to 6 consecutive flashes occur without response (i.e. 9 to 18 seconds without response of the patient). Timepoints of assessment: baseline, 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year. \n6. Exercise capacity. At baseline a practice test will be performed at least one hour before the actual test. The highest 6-minute walk distance will be reported as the patient's 6-minute walk distance at baseline. Timepoints of assessment: baseline, 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year. \n7. Physical activity. This will be objectively measured using the Actiwatch\u00ae. The Actiwatch\u00ae measures activity with a piezo-electric accelerometer that records intensity, amount and duration of movement in all directions.

The first booklet was given to patients whilst awaiting implantation. It dealt with common fears experienced by patients prior to surgery. These were identified from consultation with ICD patients themselves, healthcare staff and the research literature and explained the device. It targeted the ICD concerns that have been shown to lead to increased disability and anxiety and depression and introduced relaxation and better breathing to help patients cope with the \u0091stress\u0092 of surgery and ICD implantation\n2. The second booklet was a short one for relatives and carers detailing how they could help\n3. The third booklet explained the best way \u0091to get back to normal and avoid further problems\u0092. It was a cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation programme in self-help form. The Facilitator and the patient, and when possible the family discussed the patients\u0092 rehabilitation needs and set some simple initial goals\n4. The goal setting diary was structured to be 12 weeks in length.  The manuals are a self-help plan and can be worked through at the patients own pace\n\nThe patient and facilitator made contact three more times to discuss progress and set new goals.   \n\nControl:\nPatients in the control group received care as usual.\n\nBoth groups also received a written information booklet by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) on how to manage ICDs.

Colposcopic examination will be performed in case of abnormal cervical cytology. One of the drawbacks of cervical cytological follow-up after treatment is a high number of false-positive findings. Approximately 20% of the women present an abnormal cervical cytology. However in only half of them an underlying residual or recurrent CIN will be found, resulting in unnecessary diagnostic procedures to determine the actual residual or recurrent CIN disease. \n\nFrom several studies we know that a persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development, maintenance and progression of primary CIN lesions. It is assumed that effective treatment for CIN lesions results in the eradication of the high-risk HPV infection present before treatment. However in residual or recurrent CIN disease, is high-risk HPV still present? The use of the high-risk HPV-test during follow-up, as an adjunct to cytological follow-up, will lead to a better selection of those women at risk for residual or recurrent CIN after initial treatment for high-grade CIN lesions. \n\nThis selection results in diagnostic procedures only in patients with actual risk for developing recurrent or residual CIN lesions. Unnecessary diagnostic procedures in patients without residual or recurrent CIN can be prevented. Consequently, this policy leads to can lead to important reduction in health costs. Moreover, a better quality-of-life for the woman can be obtained.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The reduction in the number of false-positives achieved by combined testing, through increasing the specificity of testing with unaltered sensitivity, resulting in fewer diagnostic procedures.", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

Medication is often unsatisfactory for these patients, whilst specialised psychological help is usually unavailable or too costly. Research in Oxford has shown that emotional disorders in primary care can be effectively treated with a brief psychological treatment (problem-solving) given by psychiatrists or by GPs trained in the techniques. If this treatment is to be made widely available in primary care, it is desirable to train other health professionals as well as GPs. Community nurses seem well placed to receive such training. \n\nThe proposed study seeks to answer two questions:\n1. Can community nurses be successfully trained in the techniques of problem-solving?\n2. After training, how effectively can community nurses use problem-solving to treat patients with emotional disorders?\n\nIn Part One of the study, four community nurses will be trained in problem-solving and will then treat 10 patients each, under close supervision. The therapeutic techniques of the nurses will be evaluated by rating videotapes of their treatment sessions.\nPart Two of the study will be a controlled clinical trial.

The views of patients can be very difficult to obtain as many are too ill to be interviewed or to complete a questionnaire by the time they are referred to palliative care. In addition, only half of terminally ill cancer patients and fewer than a tenth of patients with non-malignant diseases who die receive specialist palliative care. Using patients as sources of data on the quality of care is therefore likely to lead to an incomplete picture of these services. An alternative method is to collect information from bereaved relatives and friends in the months after the patient's death. This retrospective approach has been used in a number of influential palliative care studies. Although there is uncertainty about the extent to which the views of bereaved relatives reflect those of the patients themselves, the great advantage is that by drawing random samples from death registrations it is possible to get information on a complete population of people who die - not just those referred to specialist services or, indeed, those known to be dying.\nTo date, retrospective surveys of care for the dying have been interview-based.  However, interview surveys are costly to execute. For many purchasers and providers the cost of an interview survey of bereaved relatives is likely to be prohibitive.  Alternatively, self-completed postal questionnaires are cheaper than interviews and need fewer trained staff to administer and analyse. A postal questionnaire which assesses use of and satisfaction with services for the dying could, therefore, be a useful addition to the limited measures available to health districts and service providers seeking to evaluate services for the dying.\nHowever, before recommending that a questionnaire be used to collect this information it is necessary to establish that this method of data collection is acceptable to bereaved respondents, and to understand whether and how responses and information collected in this way differs from that obtained in an interview survey. We therefore developed a short form of the interview schedule used successfully in previous nationally representative samples, and which covered both primary and secondary care. In the study we have investigated the effect of administering it by post on response rate, response bias and on the nature of responses to questions on service used, unmet needs for and satisfaction with services. Following consultation with health purchasers and providers a shortened version of the Regional Study of Care for the Dying (RSCD) interview schedule was developed.  This is called VOICES (Views Of Informal Carers - Evaluation of Services) and contains 42 questions about care received in the last year of life.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Questionnaire responses. Of the 431 informants who were sampled for this study, 230 agreed to take part giving a response rate of 53%. This corresponded to 56% of those approached to become postal respondents and 52% of the informants approached to become interviewees. These results demonstrate that the postal questionnaire is a viable alternative to interviews for use in collecting information on outcomes in palliative care, at least in terms of response rate. Overall the results of this study show that the postal questionnaires are a viable alternative to a face-to-face interview in retrospective bereavement surveys of care for the dying. However, particular care needs to be paid to ensuring that the wording of the questionnaire is ambivalent and are understood by members of the target population, and, in particular that respondents are helped to identify whether the deceased did in fact receive care from target services.
