The causes of anemia in the ICU can be broadly classified into two groups. The first main cause is related to the patient\u0092s illness and underlying health status. Examples would include: sepsis, overt or occult blood loss, decreased production of endogenous erythropoietin, bone marrow dysfunction, and iron deficiency anemia. The second main cause is iatrogenic. Examples would include blood loss related to blood draws/sampling and procedure related blood loss.\n\nSignificant quantities of blood are withdrawn from critically ill patients in intensive care units for the purpose of laboratory analysis.  However, much of this blood is \u0093wasted\u0094 as a significant amount (24-30%) of the removed blood is discarded.  Also, the quantity of blood sent to the laboratory for analysis is much more than what is required by the lab for analysis.  Smoller and Kruskall reported that ICU patients had a mean phlebotomy volume of 762.2 ml during their hospitalization. Patients with arterial lines had even more blood drawn:  944.0 ml. When patients have arterial lines, they have a significantly higher number of blood draws with higher discard volumes resulting in higher incidence of anemia and need for blood transfusions.  \n\nTransfusion is associated with poorer outcomes with patients receiving blood transfusion showing a higher morbidity and mortality.  A number of interventions have been studied to decrease the incidence of anemia and reduce blood transfusions in the Intensive Care Unit. These include the routine use of epogen, blood conserving devices, routine use of pediatric tubes, and restrictive strategies of transfusions. \n\nIn their study, Hebert et al. showed that a restrictive transfusion strategy was associated with lower 30-day mortality in those with lower severity of illness and a lower hospital mortality in the entire study population.  Peruzzi et al. showed that the use of a blood conserving device was safe and effective and that the device significantly lowered discard volume with resultant less decline in hemoglobin in the intervention arm. Further study by Mukhopadhay et al. revealed that the use of a similar device was associated with reduced packed RBC transfusions.  In addition, the routine use of pediatric tubes for \nphlebotomy in the ICU has been shown to result in 33% decline in the volume of blood draws for diagnostic testing with resultant lower requirements for transfusion. Our study seeks to combine a restrictive transfusion policy, a blood conserving device and the use of pediatric tubes  into a \u0093bundled\u0094 intervention.  Increasingly, \"bundles\" are being used in the intensive care unit to improve the reliability of delivering proven interventions to patients. Thus, we felt that making use of this quality improvement process would lead to more impressive changes that have been seen with these interventions individually.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims:\nMany patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU) develop a low blood count (anaemia). Researchers have \nlooked into various methods to prevent anaemia and to limit blood transfusions (due to the complications associated with this). We have also learnt that we can improve our performance if we \u0093bundle\u0094 together a number of helpful treatments for a single problem. For example, we can do a better job of preventing pneumonia in the ICU when we do a \u0093bundle\u0094 of all 5 things that we know decrease the risk of pneumonia. Therefore, in this study, we wanted to investigate if a combination of three things that prevent anaemia or blood transfusions would improve outcomes for our ICU patients if we \u0093bundled\u0094 them together. The first thing was a device called a VAMP that allows us to waste less blood when we need to take blood samples from our patients. The second was to use smaller tubes to collect the blood so less blood was being sent to the lab. Finally, we reinforced the importance of limiting blood transfusions to only those patients who absolutely required them. By bundling these three things, we hoped to show that our ICU patients would do better in terms of the number of transfusions they require as well as based on how long they need to stay in the ICU. \n\nWho can participate? \nPatients who were admitted to our ICU during the time of the study. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nWe decided to form two groups by using two similar adult medical ICUs in our hospital. In one ICU, we would do the \u0093bundle\u0094 of things mentioned above. In the other ICU, we would behave as we had in the past. Every patient who was admitted to the first ICU was enrolled in the study as long as they had a catheter in an artery or vein that would allow them to be a candidate for the VAMP device. Patients in the second ICU who also had catheters had their information recorded but they did not receive any special treatment. Other than for the bundle of therapies noted above, all patients in both ICUs were treated the same way. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThe patients who received the bundle required fewer transfusions and had less anaemia. The VAMP device has been studied by the Food and Drug Administration of the US (USFDA) and has been approved as safe to be used. There was a risk that by using smaller amounts of blood that the test would not have been able to be done and repeat blood tests would be required. There was also a risk that by limiting transfusions we could harm patients who required blood despite the lack of traditional indications for blood. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nMedical ICU \u0093pods\u0094 at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, USA. \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in April 2009 and ran for a year until April 2010. \n\nWho is funding the study? \nHenry Ford Health System, USA\n\nWho is the main contact? \nDr Bruno DiGiovine \nbdigiov1@hfhs.org", "primaryOutcome": "The number of patients who received at least one blood transfusion", "secondaryOutcome": "Number of units of blood transfused, ICU and hospital LOS, ICU and hospital mortality.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Henry Ford Health System Institutional Review Board, 24 August 2007, ref: 4637"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN99525889", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N/A"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Single center quasi-experimental design", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Prevention"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2009-04-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "United States of America"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "e0694fba-79d5-4a10-8fac-2a3337d422ec", "name": "Henry Ford Health System", "address": null, "city": "Detroit", "state": null, "country": "United States of America", "zip": "48202"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.

However, expansion of insurance coverage and corresponding increases in reimbursement rates have not kept pace with cost escalation resulting in increases in out-of-pocket spending by consumers and continuing variable and questionable effectiveness of service provision. A key underlying reason is the poor incentives faced by providers. Since the introduction of market reforms, providers were permitted to earn revenues (and make profits) by charging for services. Fee for service provider payment systems including a distorted price schedule that overcharges (\u0093cost plus\u0094 pricing) for drugs and high-technological diagnostic tests are considered major drivers of high spending while contributing to unaffordable health care and impoverishment. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of this intervention on quality of care, efficiency and demand for health care through means of a cluster randomised controlled trial. \n \nWho can participate? \nThe study takes place in two counties of Ningxia Province, covering approximately 600,000 individuals. Providers participating are those village clinics and township health centres located in the two counties.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nIn collaboration with the leadership of the Government of Ningxia Province in China, the project team has developed new policy measures with the goal of improving access to health services and quality of care. One component of the policy reforms is a shift in the payment system from fee for service to capitation with performance payments for primary care providers. Seventy percent of the annual budget is disbursed to health providers at the beginning of a year. The remaining thirty percent is withheld for performance assessment. A health provider\u0092s overall performance is measured according to an index which is generated from a large range of indicators of quality of care. The relative performance of health providers at each level of care, assessed using this quality index, determines the amount of funds disbursed.\n \nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe intervention is designed to benefit all patients seeking outpatient care at the primary care level by improving the quality and efficiency of services. Possible risks relate to unanticipated responses to the change in incentives on the part of health providers that in turn affect the quality of health care.\n \nWhere is the study run from and how long is it expected to run?\nThe project is a team effort of faculty members and graduate students from Harvard, Oxford, Fudan, Shandong, and Ningxia Medical Universities, and the officials of the Ningxia provincial and several county governments.

Pre-paid funds would have to be returned if a provider does not meet the volume threshold. To ensure there are incentives for village doctors to provide basic health care, they are also paid a per visit fee of 2 RMB, or 4 RMB if it is a home visit.

A series of peer-led community-based disease-specific self-management programs including diabetes have been developed, tested and disseminated in Shanghai in the last ten years. However, the strategy of using trained lay leaders to support patient self-management faced challenges in rural communities in Shanghai. The aim of this study is to develop a Chinese diabetes group visit program as an alternative approach to support patient self-management and to examine its effectiveness on self-management behaviors, self-efficacy and health status for patients in rural communities of Shanghai. \n\nWho can participate? \nThis study aims to recruit about 200 community-dwelling patients with type 2 diabetes from two rural communities in Shanghai, China. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nTwo groups will be created. One group will receive 12 monthly group visit sessions. Each session consists of 1.5-hour group self-management education and 1-hour one-on-one visits with health care providers. The group self-management education sessions will focus on helping participants build confidence in their ability to deal with diabetes by incorporating self-efficacy enhancing strategies, including monthly action planning and feedback, modelling of behaviors by participants for one another, reinterpretation of symptoms, practicing self-management skills, and group problem-solving. The other group will receive usual care. \nAt the end of the study, we will compare changes in self-management behaviors (diet, aero exercise, practice of cognitive symptom management, communication with doctor, and examining feet); self-efficacy to manage diabetes in general; and health status (self-rated health, energy, health distress, level of fatigue, illness intrusiveness, depression, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels) between the two groups. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nParticipants who are randomly allocated to the intervention group will receive an additional 12 monthly diabetes group visit sessions helping them improve their confidence, skills and knowledge to self-manage their type 2 diabetes. \nBy taking part in this study there are no risks of physical or psychological injury or harm. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe study is conducted by Songjiang District Center for Disease Prevention and Control in collaboration with Fudan University. \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in January 2007 to recruit participants and ended by June 2008. \n\nWho is funding the study? \nThe Initiative for Cardiovascular Health Research in Developing Countries (IC-HEALTH) (ref: ICH/DIA/PDG/O6/03) and Songjiang District Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Shanghai, China .\n\nWho is the main contact? \nDr Shengsheng Liu \ncdclss@sohu.com", "primaryOutcome": "1.

To know how much insulin needs to be given, patients need to be aware of their glucose levels so that they do not over or underdose their insulin. The information about glucose levels is traditionally acquired by fingerprick. Recently, devices have been made which measure glucose continuously by inserting a small needle-like sensor in the fat of the skin. These continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are an important tool in the treatment of diabetes and in the development of an artificial pancreas. An artificial pancreas is a device which automatically makes decisions about what amount of insulin is needed based on the glucose data from the sensor; the artificial pancreas then delivers this insulin automatically. This trial will collect data from two glucose sensors used in the treatment of patients with diabetes.\n\nWho can participate? \nPatients with type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months, aged 18 years or above, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 35 kg/m\u00b2.  Participants had to be willing to wear a CGM device for the duration of the seven study days and undergo all study procedures. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThe two sensors were inserted under the skin and recording was started. Sensor data was collected over a seven day period while the participants were at home, and at the clinical research centre. All participants were treated the same way.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere are no known benefits to participants of taking part in this study.

The subjects in the calcium supplements group received a calcium tablet each day to take after supper. Those in the other group took a dummy tablet each day, which looked like the calcium tablet, but did not contain any calcium. This was also to be taken after supper.

Insomnia is a very common problem, so providing treatment in this way could potentially reach many people who have problems sleeping. CBT is a non-drug treatment where people are helped to overcome the problem of the \u0091racing mind\u0092, and to establish a new healthy sleep pattern.\n\nWho can participate? \nAdults with persistent sleep problems, identified from their participation in the online Great British Sleep Survey. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nPeople were randomly allocated to receive CBT, the standard treatment, or to a group that had to wait to receive treatment. In all groups information on sleep, mood and daytime functions (like energy and concentration) were gathered regularly so that we could evaluate the outcomes across the 6 weeks. They were then followed up 8 weeks later to see if benefits lasted. The online CBT was delivered by a virtual sleep expert (a cartoon character). \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nBenefits of participating included improvement in daytime wellbeing and in quality of sleep. There were no known risks associated with participating in the trial. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe study was run online and there was no contact with participants except by email and through the web-based programme. \n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study ran from February to June 2011.\n\nWho is funding the study? \nSleepio Ltd, London, UK\n\nWho is the main contact? \nProfessor Colin Espie\ncolin@sleepio.com", "primaryOutcome": "1.

Participants randomised to the IRT placebo or TAU care arm will be offered CBT upon completion of the study.\n5. CBT: is a 6 session treatment course guided by an animated personal therapist. It is both engaging and interactive and uses email, SMS technologies, and other motivational tools to prompt and support the user to progressively and systematically implement behavioural and cognitive strategies\n6. The rationale given is that thoughts and behaviour influence engagement with sleep, sleep pattern and sleep quality, and subsequent daytime functioning\n7. The programme provides effective strategies to deal with sleeplessness, to reduce dysfunctional sleep behaviour, attitudes and beliefs, and to help restore normal sleep patterns\n8. The content of the therapy is based entirely upon proven methods, such as sleep hygiene education, relaxation, imagery, stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive restructuring and other cognitive techniques\n9. Social networking methods will also be used to afford support to people undertaking the CBT programme\n10. IRT: is also is a 6 session treatment, designed to mimic the structure and ethos of CBT but without any known therapeutic ingredient or advice on dealing with sleeplessness. \n11. Thus non-specific factors such as credibility, expectation, regular sessions and support will be controlled\n12. The rationale and instructions are based on a \u0091quasi-desensitisation\u0092 model\n13. The participant constructs a list of chronologically ordered typical evening/bedtime activities and a list of 6 mental images\n14. These are then paired with the hierarchy items in a pseudo-deconditioning paradigm 15. They are told that by using early evening regular practice they will become desensitised to their insomnia\n16. The IRT placebo has been validated and found credible in numerous RCTs of \u0091face to face\u0092 individual and group CBT for insomnia over the past 25 years\n17. TAU: is essentially a wait list control condition, where people complete all measures at the required times, and are entirely free to continue with whatever their usual care for insomnia is\n18.

The National Osteoporosis Society estimates that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 12 men in the UK will have osteoporosis over the age of 50 years. Dietary habits are factors likely to be important in influencing bone health in humans. In particular intakes of the mineral calcium and vitamin D for many years were considered to be implicated in causing the condition.  However, although the effects of dietary calcium on bone have been researched extensively, there is evidence for roles of other nutrients. \nEvidence is now emerging to suggest that nutrients other than calcium and vitamin D are likely to affect bone health throughout the lifespan. Choline has only recently been recognised as an essential nutrient in humans. There are a number of animal studies investigating the link between choline and bone health. These studies have reported an association between choline deficiency and bone abnormalities in chickens and geese. However, to date, there has been no work carried out to investigate the role of choline in humans and bone health.  \nHigh plasma homocysteine (tHcy) levels have been linked to osteoporosis and while the cause of elevated tHcy is considered to have many causes (including genetic, nutritional and lifestyle factors), a deficiency of one or more B vitamins certainly has a role. These vitamins are involved in the breakdown and clearance of tHcy, and thus may have a protective effect against osteoporotic fracture. The purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of the relative importance of other nutrients, other than vitamin D and calcium, namely choline, riboflavin and folate in bone health.  \nThe aims and objectives of the study were:\n1. To determine if there is an interrelationship among choline, methyl donors (i.e. folate and related B vitamins), betaine and bone status in postmenopausal women.\n2. To investigate the impact of dietary choline supplementation on various markers of bone health in postmenopausal women.\n3. To measure the effect of choline bitartrate supplementation on tHcy, related B vitamins and serum lipids.\n4. To investigate whether riboflavin/folate supplementation in participants of a particular genotype may infer a benefit on markers of bone health. \n\nWho can participate?\nApparently healthy postmenopausal women aged between 50-70 years. Postmenopausal status was defined as \u0091the absence of a menstrual cycle for up to a year\u0092\nAll volunteers were screened for a full blood picture, liver function and lipid profile. Individuals whose blood results fell outside the normal range were referred to their GP and excluded from entering the study. Other exclusion criteria included: use of vitamin B supplements, history of alcohol abuse; smoking, body mass index 30 or over; endocrine or metabolic disorders, or receiving medicine/vitamins known to influence bone heath or related B vitamin status. \n\nWhat does the study involve?\nThis study was carried out on a sample of 43 postmenopausal women. Half of the sample (23 women) received treatment with choline bitartrate and the other half (20 women) received a dummy (placebo) pill for 12 weeks.  At baseline (before they started taking the pills), 6 weeks and 12 weeks after, blood samples were taken to assess choline and B vitamin levels in their blood. Various other measures of bone health were also taken at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe benefits of taking part in this study consisted of the following: Full DEXA body scan which provides useful information regarding the state of their bone health and a full blood screening profile which provides participants with feedback regarding their liver function, lipid profile etc. This study posed no risks to participants\u0092 heath\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nThe Metabolic Suite, University of Ulster, Coleraine.\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nThis study ran between March 2004 and September 2004.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nDepartment of Employment and Learning in Northern Ireland (UK).

Furthermore, it is assumed that improvements lasting for more than three months cannot be attributed to placebo effects. However, long-term randomised placebo controlled TENS studies with treatment periods of more than three months, have not been executed.\n\nWe therefore explored the short and long-term time courses of the analgesic effects of repeated TENS application compared to sham TENS in patients with chronic pain, for a maximum period of one year.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Proportion of patients satisfied with treatment result and willing to continue treatment.

Overall improvement: a percentage change from baseline; nil percent meaning no improvement at all and hundred percent meaning complete recovery.\n2. Pain intensity is measured with a 10-centimeter long Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Descriptors at the beginning and at the end of the scale are 'no pain at all' and 'maximal imaginable pain'. Patients rate their pain at the same time every day for one week.\n3. Perceived health status is measured by the sickness impact profile (SIP). The SIP was developed to provide a measure of perceived health status that is sensitive enough to detect changes or differences in heath status that occur over time or between groups. The SIP contains 136 statements about health-related dysfunction in twelve areas of activity (sleep and rest, eating, work, home management, recreation and pastimes, ambulation, mobility, body care and movement, social interaction, alertness behavior, emotional behavior and communication.\n4. Disability because of pain is measured with the Dutch version of the Pain Disability Index (PDI). The PDI was developed as a brief, self-report indicator of pain-related disability. It was constructed as a 7-item questionnaire, which is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 10 (total disability). The items ask for the level of limitations in the total range of role functioning: family/home responsibilities, recreation, social activities, occupation, sexual behavior, self-care and life-supporting activities.\n5. Duration of TENS use (hours) serves as a measure for compliance. Duration of actual use of the device, is registered during each visit; it can be read out by pressing a special key combination.\n6. Placebo credibility is assessed after the initial treatment period (short-term effect) by asking the patients how certain they feel about having a TENS or placebo device, using a questionnaire according to Deyo et al.\n7. Co-intervention: Registration of pain medication: The used daily dose/ the defined daily dose ratio is used to calculate the drug load in treatment groups, as published by the World Health Organization (http://www.whocc.no/atcddd/).\n8.

The laparoscopic technique reduces post-operative pain and the need for pain relieving medication (analgesics) compared to the traditional open operation to remove kidneys, which was performed through quite a large incision. Nonetheless, some patients still require a reasonable amount of pain relieving medication, including intravenous injections of morphine after laparoscopic nephrectomy.  We wish to study methods of decreasing the amount of post-operative pain even further.\nWe would like to investigate the use of a local anaesthetic technique called the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block. This is a method of anaesthetising or numbing the nerve endings in the abdominal wall at the site of the operation incisions.  It involves injecting a local anaesthetic agent into this region after the patient has gone to sleep under general anaesthetic and before the surgery begins.  Previous studies have shown that this technique can reduce pain after operations such as caesarean section but there are no studies, so far, in patients undergoing kidney donation. \n\nWho can participate? \nEvery patient over 18 years that has completed the full work-up for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and is eligible will be approached for the trial. A total of 50 patients, 25 in each group will be required for the study.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nIn this study, patients undergoing a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy at Leicester General Hospital will be randomly allocated to have either the TAP block, with local anaesthetic (Bupivacaine), or a similar procedure with an inert salt solution (saline) that does not contain any anaesthetic (the control group).  The study will be a so-called \u0091blinded\u0092 one in which the patient, the surgeon and the anaesthetist are unaware whether local anaesthetic has been used or not in a particular patient.  \nOutcomes of the study will be judged primarily on the amount of pain relief that is required and the level of pain patients experience after surgery. Recover will also be assessed and any nausea, vomiting and drowsiness recorded. The duration of hospital stay and time to the introduction of free oral fluids and first solid food will also be recorded. Blood samples will also be taken to assess the effects of surgery.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThis study will help to determine if the TAP block procedure is beneficial to patients undergoing laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy.\nBoth Bupivacaine anaesthetic and normal saline are routinely used in clinical practice and should cause no adverse effects. The TAP block procedure will be performed by a Consultant Anaesthetist who is experienced in the technique and giving anaesthetics for kidney donation.  As the TAP block involves injections into the skin, it is possible that this will cause a small amount of bruising in the region but this is likely to be very minor.  Local anaesthetics do have some adverse effects if they are injected directly into blood vessels.  In the unlikely event of this happening, it is possible that there could be effects on the heart and on the nervous system.  Precautions are taken to prevent injection of anaesthetics into blood vessels and the injections will also be performed using ultrasound guidance which, again, makes the procedure safer. There will be no long term risks from taking part in this study.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nLeicester General Hospital\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study will start in June 2010 and end in June 2012\n\nWho is funding the study? \nThe University of Leicester, Transplant Department\n\nWho is the main contact? \nProfessor Michael Nicholson\nmln2@le.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "1.

It will provide useful clinical information to aid the identification of those who are at risk of having low mood and will inform the development of effective interventions. \n\nTreatment Trial:\nPart two of the study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether a psychological treatment, called behaviour therapy, is effective at treating low mood in people with aphasia due to a stroke.

Antibiotics are among the most prescribed drugs in this country. Antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD) is a frequent and severe condition. It appears in 10-25% of patients in hospitals undergoing antibiotic treatment and results not only in longer hospitalisation but also a higher risk for further complications. Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is an especially severe form of AAD and occurs in 15-25% of all cases of AAD. Clostridium difficile is a naturally occurring bacteria of the healthy intestinal flora. Under suppression of the normal intestinal flora due to antibiotic treatment Clostridium difficile can grow and secrete toxins causing damage to the intestinal tissue. Patients suffering from a CDAD not only undergo a distinctive diarrhoea but may also develop life-threatening complications, e.g. pseudomembraneous colitis or toxic megacolon. AAD and CDAD are also a financial burden to the health care system. The development and evaluation of preventive strategies is one key public health challenge. In the absence of clinically evaluated alternatives, probiotics have been suggested to be help prevent \nAAD and CDAD. However, data have so far been inconclusive and recently published analyses strongly recommended that large clinical trials should be run. Perenterol\u00ae forte is a non-prescription substance approved in Germany for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea and treatment or prevention of travellers' diarrhoea or diarrhoea due to tube feeding. The active ingredient is Saccharomyces boulardii. Saccharomyces boulardii is considered the most promising probiotic substance for the prevention of AAD and CDAD and is the object of this trial.\n\nWho can participate? \nEvery contractually capable adult who receives systemic (oral/intravenous) antibiotic treatment while hospitalised in one of our trial centres can participate after signing the written consent form, as long as they comply with inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nPatients receive the drug Perenterol\u00ae forte or a dummy drug twice daily. The capsules are taken orally for the duration and one week following antibiotic treatment. The patient independently records his/her stool frequency and consistence in a diary during the treatment and for another 6 weeks after the treatment.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nRisks due to participation in this trial are minimal.\nSac. boulardii is a living micro-organism which is able to cause generalized fungal infections under adverse circumstances (e.g. immune deficiency) by migration from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream or by external contamination of central venous catheters. Individual cases of these generalized fungal infections have been detected in hospitalised patients with central venous catheters additionally suffering from a severe underlying disease mostly localised in the gastrointestinal tract. Known side effects are flatulence and hypersensitivity reactions to the point of anaphylactic shock or sepsis. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nA number of German centres\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe recruitment started in June 2010.

Depression and anxiety are common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Improving psychological outcomes may improve quality of life. In addition it could reduce demands on other NHS services. Although drug treatments are available, these are not appropriate for everyone. Psychological treatments may provide an alternative, but there are few high quality randomised controlled trials investigating these for people with MS. Such trials are needed in order to determine whether psychological services should be developed further. The purpose of this study was to find out whether attending group treatment sessions, which offer ways to cope with anxiety and depression, was helpful. We developed a group programme and the feedback from people who attended the groups in our pilot study was very positive. We then wished to conduct a larger study to find out whether these groups should be provided as part of routine clinical practice. The plan was to find out whether the mood of people who were offered a group treatment was better than those who were not offered the treatment and to assess the costs to the NHS of providing the service.\n\nWho can participate? \nPeople with MS who were known to the MS service in Nottingham\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nWe invited people with MS to complete questionnaires about their mood. Those who had low mood, according to their questionnaire scores, were invited to take part in the study. People were allocated on the basis of chance to attend group treatment sessions or to go on a waiting list. \nGroup A: Everyone was offered 6 fortnightly, group treatment sessions. The sessions lasted about 2 hours, with breaks, and each session had a topic of the day, such as: worry, gloom, relationships, problem solving, and the future.\n Group B. These people were not offered the group treatment until after the study was completed. They received all other clinical services as usual.\n At the end of the programme, everyone, both those who attended the group and those who did not, was asked to complete questionnaires. These included measures of mood, quality of life and the impact of MS on their lives to determine the effects of the treatment.  These questionnaires were repeated 3 months later to determine whether any benefits were maintained.\nWe also collected information on the costs of providing the service.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nParticipants may have had psychological treatment which would not otherwise have been available. There were no known risks associated with participating in this study. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe MS service in Nottingham. \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in June 2008 and finished in September 2009\n\nWho is funding the study? \nMultiple Sclerosis Society (UK)\n\nWho is the main contact? \nProfessor Nadina Lincoln\nNadina.Lincoln@nottingham.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "Mood measured by the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12), follow up at 4 months and 8 months post-randomisation", "secondaryOutcome": "Hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to measure mood.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "MREC approved (ref: 04/Q2404/105)"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN29381417", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "5790"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised interventional treatment trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2008-06-02T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2009-09-30T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "f95bb212-6169-48c5-924e-d89259cc4d29", "name": "Institute of Work, Health & Organisations", "address": null, "city": "Nottingham", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "NG8 1BB"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "Inclusion criteria added as of 19/11/2012:\n1.

Ability to produce voluntary contraction of paretic muscle, as measured by the Motricity Index \u0096 arm section. The rationale for this measure is that OTI therapy is primarily directed at improving the ability to voluntarily contract paretic muscle after stroke. The Motricity Index is a clinical measure of the ability to voluntarily contract paretic muscle. It is an ordinal score with six levels of measurement within each of three categories for the upper limb (pinch grip, elbow flexion and shoulder abduction), has been used widely in clinical research, is valid, reliable and sensitive to change after stroke. \n2. Ability to produce force in paretic muscle, as measured by torque about the elbow joint during isometric flexion concentric contraction using a digital myometer and maximum pinch and grip force during isometric concentric contraction using a digital pinch/grip analyser (MIE Medical Research Ltd, UK). \n3. Ability to use the paretic upper limb in functional activity as measured by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). This is a test of upper limb function with subsections covering grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement. It has good validity and reliability and is widely used in clinical research. \n4. Adverse event monitoring and recording. There is a small risk that for some people the therapy might lead to an 'overuse' syndrome which presents as pain in the arm and/or hand. We will monitor this by checking for participant report of upper limb pain, either verbal or behavioural (e.g., grimacing, postural guarding), and for decrease in Motricity Index upper limb score of at least two measurement levels.", "secondaryOutcome": "No secondary outcome measures", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "1.

The question framework provides a flexible guide for the therapist to shape the interview, based on patients' level of interest and responses. The therapist follows the residents' cues, helping then to structure and organise their thoughts, for example, by asking questions about time sequences, how events are causally related to each other and facilitating the disclosure of thoughts, feelings and memories. These interviews are tape-recorded, quickly transcribed verbatim then shaped into a narrative using a formatted editing process. This includes clarifications (eliminating colloquialisms, non-starters and sections not related to the \"generativity\" material, such an interruptions), chronological corrections, tagging and editing any content that might inflict significant harm on recipients of the document (after discussion with the resident) and finding a suitable ending for the document which is appropriate to the residents' overall message. Another session is arranged for the therapist to read the edited transcript to the participants, who are invited to make any editorial suggestions, including identifying errors of omission or commission.

One of our goals was to investigate if psychological or spiritual treatments are more effective for patients who actively chose one of these treatments compared to patients who wished to have treatment but didn\u0092t mind whether it was psychological or spiritual. Furthermore, we wanted to see whether patients who are at psychosocial risk (those who are anxious or depressed) before an operation might benefit from supportive treatments. \n\nWho can participate? \nThe BYPASS study aimed to recruit about 1,000 female and male patients undergoing non-emergency coronary bypass surgery partially combined with valve surgery, over 18 years of age, from the Jena University Hospital and the Heart Centre Brandenburg, Bernau, Germany. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nUpon hospital admission, patients were asked about their preference regarding supportive treatments: whether they preferred psychological treatments, spiritual treatments, treatments regardless of the profession of the therapist or if they did not want any supportive treatment. In one time period, patients got treatments according to their preference; in another time period, patients were asked about their preference but did not get any supportive treatment. At the end of the study, we compared patients who received psychological or spiritual support with patients, who stated a preference for, but did not get supportive treatments. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nPatients who received supportive treatments benefited from an improvement in their mood. There were no known risks associated with participating in this trial. \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nJena University Hospital of Jena and the Heart Centre Brandenburg, Bernau, Germany.\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThis trial started in October 2007 and finished in December 2009. \n\nWho is funding the study? \nGerman Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [DFG]), Germany.\n\nWho is the main contact? \nDr Jenny Rosendahl \njenny.rosendahl@med.uni-jena.de", "primaryOutcome": "Presence of any complication following surgery within hospital stay, and following three and six months after surgery.", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

In patients with severe obesity, significant breathing problems can develop which may prevent them from breathing properly during sleep.  This can cause a build-up of waste gas in the blood and is called respiratory failure.  Although this problem is increasingly common the best way to treat it remains unclear.  The study was designed to evaluate a new medical device aimed at better controlling patients\u0092 breathing during sleep in order to improve their breathing.\n\nWho can participate? \nPatients can participate in the study if they suffer with both severe obesity and respiratory failure without other underlying breathing or muscle problems.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThe study involves being randomly picked to receive either standard treatment or the new device for a 3 month period.  Patients will be unaware of which device they are given and will perform a number of tests to assess breathing and sleep as well as complete questionnaires to inform us as to how their condition affects their everyday lives.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nIt is not thought that there are any specific risks associated with the new device but taking part in the trial will involve additional trips to hospital.  It is hoped that the new device may offer some improvements in symptom control and tolerability for patients.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe lead study site is the Lane Fox Unit, St Thomas\u0092 Hospital part of the King\u0092s Academic Health Science Centre.\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in 2008 and was completed in 2010.\n\nWho is funding the study? \nPhilips-Respironics\n\nWho is the main contact? \nDr Patrick Murphy\npatrickmurphy1@nhs.net", "primaryOutcome": "Effectiveness of the nocturnal ventilatory support, assessed using the PaCO2 - daytime arterial blood gas (ABG) at baseline and 3 months", "secondaryOutcome": "Physiological and clinical benefits in a subgroup of OHS patients with severe obesity and marked daytime hypercapnia, assessed by the following at baseline and 3 months:\n1.

The United Kingdom Office for National Statistics report that three and a half million adults suffer with back pain the entire year.  Fourteen to fifteen million GP consultations every year in the UK are due to back pain.  Back pain costs the UK approximately \u00a310668 million accounting for 13.5% of all incapacity benefits.   Whilst there are many types of treatment for back pain, one that helps everyone has not yet been found.  \nKinesiology is a relatively new and increasingly popular alternative treatment.  It originated in the 1960\u0092s in America from a chiropractic technique and became known as Applied Kinesiology.  Applied Kinesiology is practiced by some doctors, dentists and chiropractors.  Since then many other types of kinesiology have been developed and the practice has spread to over 50 countries.  \nKinesiopractic\u00ae, otherwise known as Professional Kinesiology Practice (PKP) was developed from Applied Kinesiology in the 1980\u0092s by a New Zealand medical doctor.\nMany people who have tried PKP for back pain say it helped them. Our goal was to do a study to find out if there was any scientific evidence that PKP could help back pain.  \n\nWho participated?\nThe participants in our study were men and women aged between 18 \u0096 65 who had been diagnosed by their GP with low back pain.  We included people who had chronic low back pain (pain that had lasted for at least 3 months or more) but were otherwise well and not taking any medication except for pain killers. In order to compare the treatments properly we had to make sure that everyone in the trial had a similar type of back pain.  To do this we excluded some people from our study for example people who had already had surgery for their back pain, were waiting for surgery or had pain in another part of their back e.g. upper back.  \n\nWhat did the study involve?\nIn order to check eligibility for the trial we asked interested people to call us and answer a few questions about their pack pain over the phone.  People who appeared to have the type of back pain we were looking for were then invited to the clinic to complete some questionnaires about their back pain.  If the questionnaires confirmed they had the right type of back pain we asked people to consent to participating and we then made appointments with them to come for kinesiology treatment.  \nThe participants came to the kinesiology centre once a week for 5 weeks to have their kinesiology treatment.  They completed some questionnaires each time about how their back pain had been during the previous week which helped us find out if the treatment was helping.  \nEveryone in the study received kinesiology treatment.  We wanted to test 2 types of kinesiology for back pain to see which was best. The statistician placed our participants into 3 treatment groups using a process called randomization which is rather like a coin toss.  Only the practitioner knew which group each person was in.  People received either traditional PKP or another type of kinesiology treatment.  The people in the first two groups started their treatment straight away and people in the third group started their treatment a bit later.  \nSeven weeks after kinesiology treatment had finished, people completed a final set of questionnaires by post to help us find out if there were any lasting improvements.\n\nWhat were the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe benefits we hoped that everyone would receive from the treatments were less pain, more flexibility, a general feeling of wellness and to be able to do more. There are no serious side effects with kinesiology as it is a very safe treatment and none were reported.  Three people in our study felt a bit tired and achy after treatment but this only lasted about 24 hours or less.  In complementary medicine these effects are quite common and are thought to indicate that the treatment is helping.\n\nWhere was the study run from?\nThe study took place in a private kinesiology office in Surrey.\n\nWhen did the study start and how long did it run for?\nThe trial took place during 2008 \u0096 2009 and ran for 12 months\n\nWho funded the study?\nWe didn\u0092t receive any funding for the study.\n\nWho was the main contact?\nDr Susan Eardley  \nS.Eardley@soton.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "Back pain disability measured on the Roland Morris Disability Scale, a 24 item tick questionnaire where a score of at least four points indicates a clinical problem suficient to measure change and a reduction of 2.5 after treatment indicates clinical change.

Which of the two techniques under investigation most reliably makes upper front teeth numb? \n2. How long does numbness last after each injection method? \n3. Which injection technique is the most comfortable to receive?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims:\nTeeth in the upper jaw are usually anaesthetised (made numb) for dental treatment by injecting local anaesthetic solution above the tooth to be worked upon. Although less commonly done in the upper jaw than the lower, multiple teeth can be anaesthetised by a single injection that blocks conduction in a more major nerve, such as the Infra-Orbital, Anterior or Middle Superior Alveolar Nerves. There are no previously published studies comparing the effectiveness of nerve blocks in the upper jaw.\nThe study was carried out to see whether the Anterior/Middle Superior Alveolar Nerve block (AMSA) and Infra-Orbital Nerve block (IONB) work as well, for as long, and as quickly as one another and that both injections are associated with similar levels of discomfort. \n\nWho can participate?\nTwenty eight healthy adults were recruited to the study. We were unable to accept: individuals under 18 years of age; those unable to give informed consent; individuals with medical conditions including bleeding disorders, disturbances of sensation, allergies to dental local anaesthetic drugs, pregnant women and those with missing or dead upper teeth.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nParticipants attended on two occasions, at least 1 week apart and received an AMSA injection on one of the appointments and an IONB injection on the other. The order was randomly allocated. Both injections were of lidocaine with adrenaline, administered by the same person, using a computer-controlled injection system. Participants were invited to rate any discomfort associated with the injections.\nDuring the next 47 minutes, teeth were tested with an electronic pulp tester to assess whether their nerves had feeling.\nParticipants were asked to report back how long their lip had felt numb after the injection.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nBenefits include contributing to the body of knowledge on dental local anaesthesia and helping to improve the comfort and care of dental patients in the future.\nRisks include slight bruising and discomfort at the sites of injection, accidental damage to lips and gums when they are numb and unexpected bad reactions to local anaesthetic agents.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nNewcastle Dental Hospital, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nThe study was run in the spring of 2008, and lasted for approximately 1 month.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nNewcastle University\n\nWho is the main contact?\nDr John Whitworth\njohn.whitworth@newcastle.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "Numbness of upper front teeth following local anaesthetic injection, assessed by electric pulp testing at each visit (Average duration of procedure: 1 hour)", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

aimed to examine the acceptability and mechanisms of action of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) delivered to patients in remission, but with a history of serious suicidal thoughts or behaviour. The aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of delivering MBCT to this population, and the extent to which treatment with MBCT could reduce vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and behaviour through an examination of its effects on psychological factors linked to of suicidal vulnerability.\n\nWho can participate? \nParticipants aged between 18 and 65 who were currently well but reported at least one prior episode of major depression accompanied by serious suicidal thoughts were recruited from general practitioners and local psychologists/psychiatrists and from the community. All participants were required to be well (no more than one week of minimal depressive symptoms in the past 8 weeks), and to have experienced no episodes of mania for at least 6 months. Additional exclusion criteria included current psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder or eating disorder as their main problem, current deliberate self harm on a regular basis, a neurological disorder or an inability to complete assessments due to language difficulties or cognitive impairment.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nParticipants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to establish psychiatric history. Following this, participants completed a number of other assessment measures assessing aspects of cognitive vulnerability to depression and suicidality. These measures included assessment of residual symptoms of depression, mood-related impairments in problem solving and future thinking, autobiographical memory deficits, tendency to suppress unwanted thoughts and self-discrepancy (perceptions of distance between how one currently sees themselves and how one would like to be). Participants were then randomly allocated to either immediate treatment with MBCT or a waitlist condition. The measures were completed again at the end of treatment or waitlist phase. Following this the waitlist group received treatment with MBCT.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nBenefits included the fact that all participants were offered treatment with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, either immediately or at the end of the waitlist phase of the study. Potential risks to participants related to the distress of reporting on prior psychiatric history and the inherent challenges of engaging in a therapeutic process designed to target vulnerability to recurrent depression and suicidality.  \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Oxford\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in May 2005 and ended in December 2005\n\nWho is funding the study? \nThe Wellcome Trust\n\nWho is the main contact? \nProfessor Mark Williams \nmark.williams@psych.ox.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "1.

A person will often lose the ability to walk and use their hands following a stroke. Loss of independence and the consequent reduction in the quality of life is often associated with the loss in arm function. We proposed to investigate if treatment with electrical stimulation could be used to make the recovery of arm function easier for people who were at risk of remaining chronically disabled after their stroke.\n\nWho can participate? \nAll adult patients admitted to the City General Hospital and who had not recovered arm function within two weeks to four weeks of their stroke were eligible to participate. We planned to recruit 90 patients over a two-year period for this study.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nPatients allocated to the treatment arm were given treatment with electrical stimulation. The equipment that was used for electrical stimulation is very similar to a TENS machine which is used to treat pain.  The electrodes that delivered treatment were placed on the surface of the forearm.  There were no needles involved.  A small electrical current was passed via the electrodes to the patient\u0092s muscles. This could result in a muscle contraction (the same as you would have when you move your arm actively by yourself) and/or a tingling sensation.  We have experience of using this equipment and did not expect it to cause pain or any significant side effects. During the treatment session (maximum time of 30 minutes) patients were required to remain seated.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nTreatment with electrical stimulation may have helped the patient by preventing the development of secondary complications such as pain and limb deformities. As we proposed to recruit only patients who were suitable for the treatment the risks were small.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nKeele University and University Hospitals of North Staffordshire \n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study started in September 2004 and ended in May 2006. \n\nWho is funding the study?\nAction Medical Research and The Barnwood House Trust \n\nWho is the main contact?\nProfessor Anand Pandyan\na.d.pandyan@keele.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "Change in the Action Research Arm Test score at recruitment (2 - 4 weeks post-stroke) and at the end of study (one year post-stroke)", "secondaryOutcome": "Added 09/01/2009:\n1.

The IPS model involves integrating an employment specialist into the community mental health team. This model focuses on rapid placement with continued follow-up support. The IPS model also seeks to find employment opportunities that are consistent with participants' preferences, skills, and abilities. Ongoing supervision and consultation will be provided by local experts in the use of supported employment models (status employment). The duration of the treatment is up to two years.\n\nControl group:\nThe comparison condition consists of existing psychosocial rehabilitation and day care programmes available in the local area, which use a sheltered vocational rehabilitation approach. Unlike IPS, the comparison services are coordinated with, but not integrated into the community mental health teams. This is therefore a Treatment As Usual (TAU) control, which we have selected after considering options for a control matched for staff intensity of input, but we have ruled this out as current day care and voctional rehabilitation options are multiple and often intensive in the study areas (Croydon and Lambeth).\n\n\nFurther information (as of 23rd January 2007):\nAn adjunctive qualitative study is due to commence in November 2006.  A semi-structured questionnaire will ask clients their views on any support they may have received to help them look for work, barriers to finding work, state benefits, positive and negative aspects of working and disclosure of mental health problems at work.
