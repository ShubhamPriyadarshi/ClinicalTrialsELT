Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in industrialised countries showed that HPV based screening allows earlier detection than cytology of persistent high-grade intraepithelial lesions. One of them also showed increased effectiveness, compared to cytology, in preventing invasive cervical cancer. A RCT conducted in rural India showed increased effectiveness of HPV testing vs. cytology in preventing the incidence of advanced (stage 2+) cervical cancers and death from cervical cancer. RCT results suggest the same protection, independent of having used HPV testing alone or in combination with cytology as primary screening test. In addition protection seems to be the same if all HPV positive women are referred to colposcopy or if \u0093cytological triage\u0094 (as described below) is applied. On the other hand the positive predictive value of referral to cytology is similar to or event better than that of cytology if stand alone HPV is used as primary screening test. Instead it decreases if HPV testing is  used in combination with cytology as primary screening test and if all HPV positive women are referred to colposcopy. One RCT suggests relevant over-diagnosis of regressive CIN by HPV testing in women below age 35 years. Therefore stand-alone HPV testing for primary screening with cytological triage women aged 35 years or more seems an effective and safe screening strategy.    \nIn this situation it is needed to evaluate the applicability and sustainability of this approach in routine practice and its impact on costs, participation to screening.

Resveratrol has been shown to improve health and slow the progression of disease in various models. Several cardioprotective mechanisms have been identified including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic actions. Each of these actions is thought to have the ability to attenuate the pathophysiology underlying the cardiac structural remodelling which results from acute myocardial infarction. Both in acute and in chronic models, resveratrol attenuates myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and reduces ventricular arrhythmias.\nBoron compounds are known to show a variety of different biological activities. The soluble carbohydrate compounds of B buffer the reactive species of oxygen by developing organic peroxyborates. Boron exhibits inhibitory action on various enzymes, and particularly on prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases COX-1 and COX-2.\n\nIt is more ethically justified to use active components in each group.

Whole blood is sampled 24 hours after the procedure and placed in 7 ml plastic tubes containing the anticoagulant heparin (50 U/ml). For patients who received IIb/IIIa inhibitor tirofiban, blood samples are obtained at least 24 hours after the completition of tirofiban infusion. Blood samples are stored on the room temperature for 30 minutes, diluted (1:2) with 0.9% NaCl solution and incubated on 37 +/- 0.5 \u00b0C for 3 minutes, using a computer-controlled electronic pipette.\n\nASPI test is used to detect the effect of aspirin using the ciclooxygenase substrate arachidonic acid (final concentration 0.5 mM/L). ADP test is used to assess the blockade of ADP receptor by clopidogrel. Aggregation is continuously recorded for 6 minutes after ADP (final concentration 6.4 gM/L) is added. PGE1, as a suppressor of intracellular free calcium, is simultaneously added to increase the test's sensitivity to ADP. The increase of impedance is transformed to aggregation units (AU) that are plotted against time as area under the curve (AU/min). TRAP test resembles direct activation of the thrombin receptor using the thrombin receptor activating peptide (final concentration 32 gM/L).\n\nPRA above 50%, compared to the basal value estimated by TRAP test, is linked with low responding (LR) to clopidogrel. A 150 mg daily clopidogrel is instituted in low-responders (LRs) during the first 30 days after the procedure. The second APRA is obtained 7 days after the first test. In LRs, the 500 mg maintenance dose of ticlopidine is administrated instead of clopidogrel. A 300 mg aspirin daily is administrated during the next 30 days to all patients without contraindications. After 30 days, the doses will be reduced to 100 mg aspirin and 75 mg clopidogrel. \n\nPatients will be followed-up at 30 days and 1 year after enrolment by telephone interviews and/or outpatient visits. Interviewers will be blinded to the results of platelet aggregation. An independent Clinical Event Committee will adjudicate the occurrence of the major events and major bleeding. Safety data will be reviewed monthly by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee. Statistical analyses will be performed by the Institute for Medical Statistics and Informatics, School of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nStatistical analysis:\nContinuous variables are expressed as median values with 25th and 75th quartiles, whereas categorical variables are expressed as frequency and percentage. Analysis for normality of data are performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Baseline differences between groups are analysed using the independent Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, and Pearson X2 test for categorical variables. Univariable logistic regression model is used to identify risk factors influencing clinical outcomes at 30-day follow-up. Time-to-event outcomes are presented using Kaplan-Meier curves; differences between groups are compared using a 2-sided log-rank test.

The messages provided to the patients by their caregiver will be specifically according to the manual for the trial.\n\nThe \"intensive neurophysiology education\" is developed by a group of British and Australian researchers as an education program for patients with LBP. The cognitive elements of this program is basically an understanding of pain which differs somewhat from the traditional \"injury model\". The core of this theory is the neurophysiology of pain as sensitisation and neuronal response to inactivity and movement control. \n\nBased on this, the education program has three basic elements: \n1. Reduction of what the patient perceive as threatening inputs to the brain\n2. Targeting the patients\u0092 own understanding of the pain\n3. Exposure to the threatening inputs\n\nPrevious studies have documented additional effect of the \"intensive neurophysiology education\" when combined with physiotherapy treatment. The treatment will be given in four 30-minute sessions once a week for four consecutive weeks. The treatment is specified in a manual for this trial and all intervention doctors and physiotherapists have attended the 18 lessons course.

Eventually, the education program will be more and more dealing with exposure to movements and daily activities the patient more or less deliberately avoid of fear from provoking pain. The patients will be given lessons between the sessions, in addition to registrations on function, pain and work absence. \n\nControl group:\nThe providers of the two control groups will be asked to in a similar manner register and include all patients meeting the inclusion criteria.

OSAHS is caused by relaxation of the upper airway during sleep, predisposing the airway to narrowing and eventual collapse. The restoration of airway patency is achieved by short arousals from sleep to allow breathing before sleep ensues again. The treatment of choice for OSAHS is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which is a mechanical treatment involving the patient wearing a nasal mask during sleep, through which is blown a gentle airstream that splints the upper airway open, preventing collapse, breathing pauses, sleep disruption and dips in oxygenation. \n\nThis randomised controlled cross-over trial will seek to determine whether OSAHS patients on variable-pressure CPAP (AutoSet Spirit\u2122) for six weeks have better outcomes over fixed-pressure CPAP for: \n1.

To conduct this programme for the purpose of research and for developing sustainable good practice models. \n3. To initiate broad diffusion and establishment of the program in institutions providing geriatric care. \n\nConceptual framework \n1. Different levels of issues and interventions are playing roles, when preventive training in residential care is to be developed and implemented: \na. Individual-social level \nb.

Instituting NIV in a distressed, dispnoeic individual and matching the ventilator to the patients requirements is difficult. The early introduction of NIV is easier (the patient is better able to cooperate and lower, more comfortable inflation pressures can be used) and may interrupt a vicious cycle of deterioration before it is well established. Moreover simpler ventilations, which do not require great expertise and are therefore practical for use in non-specialist units, can be used.
