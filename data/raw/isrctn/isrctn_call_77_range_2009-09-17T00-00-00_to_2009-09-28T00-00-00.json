It has a narrow therapeutic window and highly variable pharmacokinetic characteristics. Though therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is adopted universally to monitor trough concentration and adjust doses, its hysteresis makes it still not an optimal solution. Many studies suggested that genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolising enzymes (mainly CYP3A5), drug transporters (P-glycoprotein, encoded by MDR1) and upstream regulators (PXR) may be responsible for the inter-individual differences in pharmacokinetics, so using of genetic information to plan drug dosing has great potential for improving safety and efficacy profile of tacrolimus. \n\nTacrolimus is expensive and theoretically a life-long medication, so it's undoubtedly a heavy financial burden for medical insurance system and patients, especially for those high-dose users. Therefore, efforts have been made to decrease patients' consumption of tacrolimus yet still keep its blood concentration within target therapeutic window. Coadministration with agents that inhibit the metabolism and facilitate the absorption of tacrolimus has been proved to be a useful method. For example, diltiazem, an anti-hypertensive agent from calcium channel blocker family, would inhibit CYP3A and P-glycoprotein and has been used as a tacrolimus-sparing agent for many years. Recently, it has been found that coadministration with Schisandra sphenanthera extract (SchE, a prescribed hepatoprotective drug) could significantly increase in vivo whole blood concentration of tacrolimus, indicating that SchE may also be an efficient tacrolimus-sparing agent with potential therapeutic and financial saving benefits. Studies about substances in SchE revealed that some of them are strong CYP3A inhibitors, while some act on P-glycoprotein, these may be the primary reasons for its potent tacrolimus-sparing effect. \n\nOn the basis of our previous retrospective studies and reports from other researchers, we propose the hypnoses as follows: \n1. Verifying the polymorphism of CYP3A5, MDR1 and PXR could predict necessary dose for individuals. \n2. Schisandra sphenanthera extract can affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, increase its bioavailability. The above effect is of clinical significance, safe and stable, which makes it meaningful for tacrolimus-sparing in clinical settings. \n3.

The 24-hour sample is just prior to the next day administration. If possible, on the day of pharmacokinetic blood sample collection, concomitant medications should not be taken for two hours following imatinib administration. On day 14, and monthly during the imatinib treatment, only one blood sample (7 ml) will be taken, just prior to the daily imatinib administration. After collection, blood samples will be placed on ice and within 10 minutes will be processed to plasma by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 2,500 G (4\u00b0C). Plasma should be transferred to polypropylene tubes, which will be stored at T less than -70\u00b0C until the time of analysis. All drug concentrations will be measured at the Laboratory of Experimental Chemotherapy and Pharmacology of the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, by a validated reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with fluorescence detection, as will be described elsewhere. Pertinent pharmacokinetic parameters include the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax), the sampling time of this concentration (tmax), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a dose interval (24 hours, AUC-T), the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0h to infinity (AUC = AUC(0-tz) + C(tz)/k where AUC(0-tz) is the area under the concentration-time curve from 0h to the last sampling time point (tz) with a quantifiable concentration (tz less than 24 h), C(tz) the concentration at tz and k the terminal disposition rate constant), total plasma clearance (CL = dose/AUC), the rate constant of the terminal disposition phase calculated by linear regression analysis to the log-linear concentration-time plot (k), and the apparent half-life of the terminal disposition phase (T1/2 = ln 2/k). The relative extent of CYP3A4-mediated formation of CGP74588 will be evaluated as the AUC ratio of CGP74588 and imatinib. Analysis will be performed on WinNonlin software program (Pharsight, USA).\n\nPharmacodynamics:\nPharmacodynamic evaluation will involve analysis of WBC and ANC nadir as a function of the treatment, expressed in absolute values (in 10^9/litre). In addition, potential relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic outcome will be assessed using predefined models based on the Hill function (for haematological toxicity). The categorical variables considered are as follows: metastatic GIST, adjuvant GIST or CML, primary tumour or recurrence present, liver tumour burden, stomach lesions, GIST or CML histology, gastrointestinal origin of the disease, abdominal origin of the disease, prior surgery, prior radiotherapy, prior chemotherapy. The continuous variables considered are the following: time since initial diagnosis of GIST or CML in days, white blood cell count, granulocytes, platelets, haemoglobin, creatinine, creatinine clearance (by Cockroft-Gault formula), bilirubin, SGOT, SGPT, albumin, alkaline phosphatase. In patients with liver metastases the liver tumour burden shrinkage during treatment with imatinib. \n\nTotal duration of treatment is until clinical progression, but, for the study objective, we will follow until 1 year from the beginning of the treatment.

Every minute without CPR reduces survival by 10 to 15%. In our pre-hospital setting there is 50% success in returning the spontaneous circulation (Return Of Spontaneous Circulation, ROSC) after CPR. Only half of these patients survive to discharge from hospital. \nThat is why more thoughts should be pointed to intra- and post-reanimation care meaning preservation and protection of the brain and heart function. Only this provides the chance of survival to be wholesome. Immediately after ROSC there is a period of brain hyperemia. 15 to 30 minutes after ROSC brain perfusion decreases and because the autoregulation of the brain is lost, perfusion of the brain mainly depends upon mean arterial pressure. Brain oedema, focal haemorrhages and instability of circulation lead to further brain ischaemic lesions.\n\nThe aim of our research is to determine the impact of erythropoietin on survival and neurological outcome of cardiac arrest victims. On the basis of previous preclinical and clinical data about eryrhropoietin (EPO) therapy for acute stroke and acute myocardial infarction we expect that giving erythropoietin early in the course of cardiopulmonary resuscitation would decrease the ischaemic and reperfusion damage to the brain and heart.\n\nHypothesis: The group of patients in cardiac arrest who are treated with erythropoietin have better survival (discharge from hospital) and neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC]). We expect that giving erythropoietin early in the course of cardiopulmonary resuscitation would decrease the ischaemic and reperfusion damage to the brain and heart after a period of cardiac arrest and thus it would improve neurological outcome of these patients. Key questions are: \n1. What is the survival rate of the patients who received EPO compared to those who didn't? \n2. Does the new approach to the cardiac arrest victims improve their survival? \n3. Is there any difference in the neurological outcome between the two groups?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Neurological outcome assessed by CPC,  from CPC-1 (normal neorological status) to CPC-5 (brain death).

Increased monitoring and positive attention to children are provided through high school age mentors and adult volunteers (know as \u0093Brunos\u0094) who provide support to children and teachers during recess and transition periods during the school day.

This consultant participated in weekly Student Resource Team (SRT) meetings (approximately one hour per week), and spent three hours weekly consulting with school staff. The consultant aimed to become an integral part of the SRT, using specialised expertise in child psychiatry/psychology to assist in data gathering, intervention and assessment planning, and (when indicated) liaisons with mental health service providers in the community.  The overriding goal of this consultation is to address more comprehensively the mental health needs of children exhibiting significant emotional or behavioural problems at school.

After this period, the patients were switched to flow-triggering pressure-support (PS) ventilation with the level of pressure assist adjusted to obtain a tidal volume (VT) of 7-10 ml/kg.  Extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of approximately 1-2 cmH2O lower than PEEPi, measured on controlled mode, was applied. The threshold for triggering was set to 2 l/min. Propofol and remifentanyl infusions during VC and PS mode were titrated such as to obtain sedation levels 6 and 3 on the Ramsey scale respectively. If patients were stable on PS with adequate gas exchange, respiratory frequency less than 30 breaths/min and without clinical evidence of excessive work of breathing, all bronchodilators were withheld for 6 hours. By the end of this period patients were re-evaluated and if they had a respiratory frequency of less than 30 breaths/min, adequate gas exchange and no clinical evidence of excessive work of breathing they were prospectively randomized to receive 4 puffs of salbutamol (S, 100 \u00b5g/puff given by an MDI canister, Aerolin inhaler, GlaxoWellcome) being ventilated either on PS or VC mode. On VC mode, VT and ventilator frequency were set to values similar to these on PS. A square wave flow pattern was used and no end-inspiratory pause time was applied. No manipulation was performed on PS. After a six hour washout-period, the patients were crossed-over to receive the drug by the alternative mode of ventilation. The MDI was adapted to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit using an aerosol cloud enhancer spacer (ACE, Diemolding Healthcare Division, USA), whereby the MDI flume is directed away from the patient. The spacer was placed just before the Y-ventilator connector. The canister was shaken before each series of puffs.
