In the last decade combined modality treatment in stage III and chemotherapy in stage IV improved the survival and quality of life (QOL) in NSCLC patients. Unfortunately a vast majority of patients will not be fit enough to undergo these intensive treatments, and those who underwent chemotherapy as palliative treatment may eventually still suffer from loco-regional complaints. \n\nIn general, hemoptysis, chest pain, dysphagia, and dyspnoea can all be effectively palliated with acceptable toxicity with all kinds of different radiation treatment schemes. The effectiveness of these different treatment schemes however varies for each different symptom and is most effective for hemoptysis and chest pain in patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade status of 2 - 3. Which dose should be given is still controversial. \n\nIn the first Medical Research Council (MRC) trial reported in 1991 no differences in palliative effect and in survival were seen between 13 x 3 Gy and 2 x 8.5 Gy. In a second MRC study in 1992 for poor prognostic patients only, no differences in palliation or survival were seen between 10 Gy single dose and 2 x 8.5 Gy. However in a study by Bezjak et al. a difference in survival between 20 Gy in 5 fractions and a 10 Gy single dose was demonstrated in favour of the multi-fractionation treatment. In a group-analysis, however, this survival advantage was not seen in patients with an ECOG score of 2 or more. Later data suggested a survival advantage of 13 x 3 Gy over 2 x 8.5 Gy in patients with good performance status. \n\nFor patients in a bad general condition it still has to be proven whether 2 x 8.5 Gy is equally effective as 10 x 3 Gy. Based on these findings radiation oncologists in the Netherlands could not reach consensus on the appropriate fractionation schedule for palliative irradiation of bad prognosis NSCLC patients. The presented study therefore was focused on patients with bad general condition and/or significant weight loss with stage III NSCLC or stage IV patients, not suitable for chemotherapy, comparing 10 x 3 Gy with 2 x 8 Gy.\n\nPurpose: \nThis multicentre randomised National Study compared the efficacy of 2 x 8 Gy versus our standard 10 x 3 Gy in patients with inoperable stage IIIA/B (with ECOG score 2 - 4 and/or substantial weight loss) and stage IV Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). \n\nHypothesis:\nWe expected both treatment arms to have an equal outcome for palliation as for prognosis, because of the above-mentioned results of the MRC studies.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Palliation of thoracic symptoms measured over 52 weeks after randomisation.

Compare the effect of such a regimen to that of the previously recommended regimen of 200,000 IU of vitamin A given to mothers and 3 doses of 25,000 IU of vitamin A given to their infants concurrently with DPT/Polio immunisations\n3. Measure the side effects of 50,000 IU of vitamin A administered with DPT/Polio immunisations\n\nThe outcomes to be monitored for the above objectives include serum retinol levels, modified Retinol Dose Response (mRDR) tests, incidence of side effects such as bulging of the anterior fontanel and vomiting, and incidence of severe morbidity.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to:\n4. Measure the effect of the maternal dose on breast milk retinol levels up to 9 months post partum\n5. Examine if any impacts on infant vitamin A status are sustained beyond 6 months of age up to 9 months of age\n\nOutcomes to be monitored for the secondary objectives include breast milk retinol concentrations and mRDR testing of infants at 9 months of age.\n\nRelated to the main objectives, the following hypotheses will be tested:\n1. Giving 400,000 IU of vitamin A to mothers within 6 weeks of delivery, plus 50,000 IU given to their infants with their DPT/Polio immunisations, will improve infants' vitamin A status as measured by mean serum retinol, or by proportions below 20 ug/dl, or proportions of abnormal mRDR at 6 months of age. The proportion of infants with serum retinol concentration below 20 ug/dl will be reduced by 66% from 43%, which was achieved by the 25,000 IU-dosing regimen.

Giving 50,000 IU of vitamin to infants with their DPT/Polio immunisations will produce no clinically significant side effects\n\nThe following additional hypotheses will be tested for the secondary objectives:\n3. Giving 400,000 IU of vitamin to mothers in the post partum period will result in a greater improvement in breast milk retinol levels than that achieved with 200,000 IU, and that this improvement will be sustained up to 9 months\n4.

Measure the effect of 400,000 IU of vitamin A given in two divided doses of 200,000 to mothers, and 3 doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin A given to their infants concurrently with Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT)/Polio immunisations, on vitamin A status of the infants at 26 weeks of age\n2. Compare the effect of such a regimen to that of the previously recommended regimen of 200,000 IU of vitamin A given to mothers and 3 doses of 25,000 IU of vitamin A given to their infants concurrently with DPT/Polio immunisations\n3. Measure the short-term side effects of each of the two doses of 200,000 IU given to mothers, and of the 50,000 IU of vitamin A administered with each of the three DPT/Polio immunisations\n\nThe secondary objectives are to:\n1. Measure the relative effect of the two different maternal dosing regimens on the breast milk retinol concentration up to at 6 and 9 months post partum\n2. Measure the effect of the maternal doses of vitamin A on the relative incidence of short-term side effects in the mother over the 48-hour period after the first and second 200,000 IU maternal doses of vitamin A\n3. Measure the effect of the maternal doses of vitamin A on the breast milk retinoic acid concentration 3 hours after the first and second 200,000 IU maternal doses of vitamin A\n4. Examine if any relative impacts on vitamin A status are sustained at 9 months of age\n\nRelated to the main objectives, the following hypotheses will be tested:\nHYPOTHESIS 1: Giving 400,000 IU of vitamin A to mothers within 6 weeks of delivery, plus 50,000 IU given to their infants with their DPT/Polio immunisations, will improve infants' vitamin A status to a significantly greater degree than giving 200,000 IU of vitamin A within 6 weeks of delivery, plus 25,000 IU given to their infants with each of their three DPT/Polio immunisations. This will be measured by mean serum retinol concentration, or by proportions below 20ug/dl, or proportions with abnormal modified Retinol Dose Response (mRDR) at 6 months of age. The proportion of infants with serum retinol concentration below 20ug/dl at 6 months of age will be approximately 37% in the comparison group infants and 27% or less in the group of infants allocated to receive the higher dose regimen.\nHYPOTHESIS 2: Giving 50,000 IU of vitamin A to infants with their DPT/Polio immunisations will produce no significant increase in the incidence of short-term side effects, relative to 25,000IU.\n\nThe outcomes to be monitored for the above objectives include serum retinol concentrations, mRDR tests, and incidence of side effects such as bulging of anterior fontanelle and vomiting, and incidence of severe morbidity.\n\nHYPOTHESIS 3: Giving 400,000 IU of vitamin A to mothers in the post partum period will result in a greater improvement in breast milk retinol concentrations at 6 months post partum than that achieved with 200,000IU, and that this improvement will be sustained up to 9 months.\nHYPOTHESIS 4: Giving a second 200,000 IU dose of vitamin A to mothers in the post partum period will result in no significant increase in the incidence of short-term side effects, relative to no second dose.\nHYPOTHESIS 5: Giving a second 200,000IU dose of vitamin A to mothers in the post partum period will result in no significant increase in the prevalence of potentially toxic breast milk retinoic acid concentrations 3 hours after the second maternal dose, relative to no second dose.\nHYPOTHESIS 6: At 9 months of age, the vitamin A status of infants who were allocated to receive the higher dose regimen will be significantly better than the status of infants who were allocated to receive the lower dose regimen.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.
