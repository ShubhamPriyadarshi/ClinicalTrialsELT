The wave then disperses radially from the application site into the tissue to be treated. The energy generated depends considerably on the working pressure to which the device has been set.

After filling out the admission form, we collect the following demographic data of the parents and the child: the age, gender of the parent present, the parent's native language, type of surgery, whether or not it is the first surgery the child undergoes, if the parents have other children who have undergone surgery, the highest qualification of the parents and if there has been a prior consultation between the parents and the anaesthetist (this will take 5 minutes).\n\nAll parents receive standard written information about what the anaesthesia implies and what will precisely happen at the induction. No premedication is given. During the whole course, a voluntary worker will be present. \n\nAt admission (the day of the surgery), the parents and their child are randomised in a control group and an intervention group. We are going to use blind-numbered envelopes to do this. This randomisation will be carried out using computer generated numbers. Men as well as women will be included in this. \n\nAfter that, we will verify the anxiety score of the parent present. We will use the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), the latter also questions the need for information. Every parent present will also be asked to fill in the two questionnaires. This will take approximately 10 minutes. \n\nThe intervention group will then receive audiovisual information, in the form of a short movie (duration: 4 minutes), the control group does not see the movie. This movie will describe the hospitalisation, the transport to the operating room, the induction and the induction of the anaesthesia by telling a story about the journey of young boy to \"Groenland\" (Greenland), a metaphor for our operating room, together with his friend \"Mister Dragon\". During the journey, the young boy meets Caroline and together with his mum he arrives in Groenland. The movie was shot at the Koningin Paola Kinderziekenhuis.\n\nAfter this, we will ask the both parental groups to fill in the state-part of the STAI (Spielberger) and the APAIS again (this will take approximately 4 minutes). After this, the child and the parent present will be guided to the operating room. \n\nDuring the induction, the anaesthetist fills in the Induction Compliance Checklist (ICC) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The anaesthetist does not know to which group the parent has been allocated.\n\nThe ICC is developed to score the child\u0092s behaviour during the induction of anaesthesia. The list consists of 11 items indicating the level obligingness of the child at induction. The total score = the amount of categories checked (perfect score = 0).\n\nThe VAS is a 100 mm horizontal line with two behavioural extremes (not anxious to very anxious) on both ends. The anaesthetist marks how anxious the child is during induction.\n\nAfter the induction of the anaesthesia on the child, the parent and the voluntary worker leave the operating room. All parents are asked to fill in the state anxiety part of the STAI (Spielberger) and the APAIS again (duration: 4 minutes).\n\nAll accompanying parents will also be asked to fill in a short additional questionnaire which will assess the general satisfaction level, the quality of the provided preoperative information and the benefit of the provided audiovisual information (intervention group only). We use a VAS scale for which the parent is asked to put a mark between the two extremes. \n\nThe questions are:\n1. Were you satisfied about the given information in connection to the anaesthesia? (absolutely not to very satisfied)\n2. Were you very motivated to be present at the induction of anaesthesia? (not to absolutely want to be present) \n3. Do you believe that your presence is useful for your child? (not useful to absolutely necessary)\n4. Are you satisfied with the course of the procedure? (totally not to very satisfied)\n5. Do you think that giving audiovisual information is useful for the preparation of anaesthesia? (intervention group only) (totally not to very useful) \n\nThe anxiety which the child has experienced according to the parent during the induction is also measured by means of a VAS scale.

This qualitative study used thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with women participants, mentors and research midwives, and took place from 01/09/2004 to 31/08/2006. 24 participants were recruited to this qualitative study. \n\nHypothesis: To explore difficulties encountered in conducting a randomised controlled trial of a peer-mentoring programme for first-time mothers in socially disadvantaged areas, in order to provide information relevant to future research and practice.\n\nThe aims of the qualitative study are to assess: \n1. Implementation and ongoing development of the programme\n2. Internal dynamics and actual operations of the mentor programme\n3. Quality and quantity of the activity undertaken by the mentors\n4. Interactions between mothers and mentors\n5. Strengths and weaknesses of the various programme components\n6. Challenges and barriers to successful implementation\n7. Mentors' and mothers' perspectives on programme effectiveness\n\nWe intend to employ a range of different qualitative methods including in-depth interviews with mentors, mothers and other key stakeholders, observations of both group and individual sessions and documentary analysis. \n\nMOMENTS Follow-up Study: Can peer mentoring in first-time mothers from areas of socially deprived area, during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life have sustained effects of child growth, health and development and maternal health and wellbeing?\nIn 2006 a follow-up study was added to this RCT (all details pertaining only to this qualitative study will be headed under the title \u0091MOMENTS Follow-up Study\u0092 in the relevant sections). This follow-up study continued on from the original RCT with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the same interventions, but with a longer-term primary outcome. This follow-up took place from 01/09/2006 to 01/09/2008. 350 participants were followed-up from the original RCT.\n\nPlease note that the target number of participants on this ISRCTN record has been amended from 500 to 340 as of 20/02/2009. Recruitment was slower than anticipated and our sample size calculation was reviewed. This determined that a final sample size of 144 in each group would allow detection of a difference of 5 points in Bayley scores (SD 15) between the two groups at one year with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.

At booking (10 - 12 weeks): basic demographic data, mother's knowledge of pregnancy and infant development, current dietary habits, feeding intentions, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol and drugs), physical and mental health (SF-36)\n2. At 22 weeks (when women attend hospital for an anomaly scan): foetal growth (biparietal diameter, femur length and abdominal circumference) and a short questionnaire on stress levels (Speilberger State Trait Anxiety Questionnaire) and maternal feelings for the pregnancy\n3. At 29 - 30 weeks: foetal growth and foetal behaviour. During a 45 minute ultrasound, the frequency and duration of movement and the foetus's startle reaction.  A two-second vibroacoustic stimulus (Corometrics) will be presented to the foetus and the response noted in the following 10 seconds (whether the foetus responded and the strength of the foetus) scored on a 10 point scale. Both measures are useful indicators of neurological well-being. Maternal self-report of anxiety levels will be obtained.\n4. At birth: Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, growth measurements (birth weight, length and head circumference) in relation to gestation, Brazelton Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale at 24 - 72 hours, method of infant feeding\n5. At 6 - 8 weeks: infant growth measurements by health visitors during routine visits in the community, details of method and amount of feeding will be noted\n6. At 7 - 8 months: infant growth and feeding data will be recorded by health visitors at routine visits and infant temperament using the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire (RITQ). Temperament is considered to represent constitutionally based individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation which represent the core of developing personality. The RITQ involves questionnaire responses from the infant's mother which measure dimensions of activity, rhythmicity, approach, adaptability, threshold, mood, intensity, persistence and distractibility. The Parenting Stress Index short form will also be completed. \n7. At 1 year: at a hospital clinic, in addition to Bayley Scores and maternal wellbeing, questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and coping (Parenting Stress Index), hospital admissions, illnesses, use of medication, immunisation status and self-efficacy.

Patients will be asked to attend the eye clinic for one visit only. Assessments will be conducted by two of the investigators - A.Ismail (Specialist registrar Ophthalmology), and M.Lamont (Senior House Officer Ophthalmology). Each patient will have their intraocular pressure and corneal thickness measured. These measurements are routinely performed in the eye clinic and are not unduly intrusive or burdensome. In order to compare pressure measurements by DCT and GAT, the following is performed: 1) It is randomised whether DCT or GAT measurement occurs first. 2) It is also randomised which investigator will perform the measurement first. 3) Each investigator measures the patients intraocular pressure in the eye being studied alternately by GAT and DCT 3 times in succession. 4) The second investigator is blind to the readings, and performs the same measurements successively. 5) In total, the patient will have their eye pressure measured 12 times in succession. 6) The corneal thickness of the eye will be measured by ultrasound pachymetry. On average, measurement of the eye pressure by either of the methods takes roughly 5 seconds, and is completely painless. Disposable tonometer heads will be used for both instruments and between patients. There are no known complications for either technique for the patient, aside from possible inaccuracy of reading. The measurement of corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry is almost an identical procedure from the patients point of view. The ultrasound probe is sterilised between patients, as is normal clinical practice. Once again there are no known complications of this investigation to the patient. Once these readings have been taken, the patient is discharged from the eye clinic, back to their usual follow up.

Somatostatin will be given at a dose of 250 \u00b5g/hour after an initial bolus of 250 \u00b5g and octreotide at 50 - 100 \u00b5g/hour after an initial bolus of 50 \u00b5g. If terlipressin is chosen, it will be given at a dose of 2 mg/4 hours. As soon as possible, always within the first 24 hours, a diagnostic endoscopy will be performed and, if the variceal origin of the bleeding is confirmed, endoscopic band ligation (preferably) or sclerotherapy will be performed. \n\nActive variceal bleeding at endoscopy will be defined, according to Baveno, as observing blood, spurting or oozing from a varix.\n\nThe Child-Pugh class will be determined from clinical characteristics at admission and on admission blood test for albumin, prothrombin activity, and bilirubin. Patients belonging to Child-Pugh class C (with a score of 10 - 13 points) or Child-Pugh class B (score of 7, 8 and 9) with active variceal bleeding at endoscopy will be considered eligible for the study. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria with no exclusion criteria and that give signed written informed consent will be enrolled in the study.  \n\nPatients will be allocated, as soon as possible, to receive optimized medical plus endoscopic treatment (group 1) or early treatment with TIPS with PTFE covered-stents (group 2). Allocation will be done centrally by the coordinating center, that will be contacted by phone, according to a computer-generated, blocked list. Allocated treatment will be kept in sealed, opaque envelops.\n\nMedical treatment (group 1):\nAfter endoscopy, if there is active variceal bleeding, if somatostatin is used, the dose will be doubled to 500 \u00b5g/hour. If the dose of somatostatin was doubled it can be decreased to the normal dose after 24 hours of being free of bleeding. \n\nPharmacological treatment will continue at least until getting 24 hours free of bleeding (preferably up to 5 to 7 days). \n\nThen, patients will begin treatment with non-selective beta-blockers (either propranolol or nadolol). After an initial dose of 40 mg, the dose of propranolol/nadolol will be increased/decreased step by step to achieve a baseline heart rate of 55 bpm or up to the maximum tolerated dose, within the limit of 160 mg twice a day (bid) for propranolol or to a maximum of 160 mg for nadolol. After adjusting the dose of non-selective beta-blockers, isosorbide-5-mononitrate is initiated, starting with 10 mg at bedtime. Two days later the dose is increased to 10 mg at 8.00 and 18.00, and at day 4 - 5 the final dose of 20 mg at 8.00 and 18.00 is reached if tolerated. In case of contraindications or intolerance to beta-blockers, patients will not receive pharmacological treatment (beta-blockers but also mononitrate) and the only treatment to prevent rebleeding will be endoscopic band ligation.\nThe first elective session of endoscopic band ligation should be performed within the first 7-14 days. The following sessions will be performed at 14 + 3 days intervals until variceal eradication (defined as disappearance of the varix, impossibility of suctioning the varix, or a maximum of six continued sessions). Once eradication is achieved, a control endoscopy will be performed one month later for confirmation. The following endoscopies will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months of inclusion and yearly thereafter. If varices reappear, new band ligation will follow.\n\nPTFE TIPS treatment (group 2):\nTIPS will be performed as soon as possible once the patients are enrolled in the study, always within the first 72 hours after the diagnostic endoscopy (preferably in the first 24 hours).\n\nDrug administration (either somatostatin, octreotide or terlipressin) will be maintained until TIPS is done.\n\nTIPS will be performed according to the practice of each center. However, for homogeneity reasons the following will be adhered to:\n1. A 10 mm Viator stent will be used, that will be dilated to 8 or 10 mm according to the hemodynamic response. The aim will be to reduce the portal pressure gradient (PPG) below 12 mmHg or by more than 50% of baseline if baseline PPG is greater or equal to 25 mmHg. Not paralleled TIPS or overdilatation are allowed.\n2. Embolisation, either with coils or bucrylate, can be performed, if it is felt necessary, especially in patients where portography shows the filling of big portosystemic collaterals feeding the varices, in association with a PPG below 16 mmHg\n3.

It is important that the trial assesses the patients' own perceptions of their functioning and addresses matters of most concern to them.

In addition to PDQ-39, the EuroQoL EQ-5D will be used as the main outcome measure for the Health Economic evaluation (see below) as this permits incremental quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) to be calculated.\n2. Dementia screen. The trial aims to determine whether therapies prevent or decrease the decline of cognitive function as measured by the DRS-II. The DRS has the ability to assess the level of cognitive impairment in different clinical populations and to differentiate between types of dementia.\n3. Clinical assessment of functioning. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS - both on and off drug therapy) and Hoehn & Yahr staging system will provide a standard neurological assessment against which to validate further the PDQ-39 in a subset of patients.\n4. Neuropsychology. A semi-structured neuropsychiatric interview and psychometric measures of depression/anxiety, and cognition (pre-morbid/current IQ, language, attention-executive functions, memory and spatial skills) in a subset of patients.\n5. Burden on carers. Little is known about the effects of PD and its treatment on carers. The person identified by the patient as their primary carer, if they have one, will be asked to complete the SF36, a well validated measure of health status.\n6. Institutionalisation rates and other measures of individual and societal cost.\n7. Toxicity and side-effects of surgery, including mortality, stroke and other serious adverse events. Toxicity and side-effects of medical therapy will also be recorded.\n8. Death from all causes and specifically from PD and the surgical procedure. Patients will be flagged with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for long-term mortality follow-up.\nSome centres will wish to undertake additional investigations (e.g. more detailed clinical assessments, including video records, neuropsychology, physiology and imaging) and we will encourage such scientific add-on studies, although they will not be part of the main trial.", "trialWebsite": "http://www.pdsurg.bham.ac.uk/", "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN34111222", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "G9900797"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Not specified"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Not Specified"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2001-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2011-09-30T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": ["England", "United Kingdom"]}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "95e5d71e-ccec-4a86-8a62-5e06319b7864", "name": "Department of Clinical Neurology", "address": null, "city": "Birmingham", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "B15 2TH"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.
