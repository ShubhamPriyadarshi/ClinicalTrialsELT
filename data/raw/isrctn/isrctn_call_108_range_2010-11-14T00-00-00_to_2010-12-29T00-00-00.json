Exposure to the newly developed intervention would lead to a significant increase in participants intention to take an HIV/STI-test (i.e. a Sexual Health Checkup), compared to exposure to the control, a pre-existing online intervention\n2. Theory predicts that high intentions towards taking a test increase the chances of actually taking a test. Therefore, compared to the control condition, significantly more participants in the experimental condition would have taken a Sexual Health Checkup at the moment of follow-up (3 months after exposure to one of the interventions).\n\nRationale:\nThe theme we chose for our health promotion program was: \"Queermasters, the online gay health show\". In consultation with our linkage group, it was considered a theme that fitted well with our target population. The concept of an online gay health show allowed us to include different rounds for different program components, virtual relational agents in terms of a show master and his assistant, and a virtual MSM audience in the background representing a reference group, and expressing an injunctive social norm. \n\nIn our program, we deliberately avoided the use of risk information and risk communication as means of motivating participants to take an HIV-test. This decision was taken on the basis of our qualitative and quantitative findings.

The children who survive nutritional insults during early life are at a high risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCD) like type 2 diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease in later life. India is today a capital of diabetes as well as of undernutrition in under-five children.\n\nThe theory of 'developmental origins of health and disease' (DOHaD) suggests that obesity, diabetes and related disorders have origins in nutritional rehabilitation of the undernourished young. Undernutrition followed by overnutrition in later life predisposes to NCD. A major concern in India is to treat and rehabilitate undernourished children especially in the rural population.\n\nWe plan to study growth and body composition of undernourished children in the age group of 6 months to 36 months, in Akola district of State of Maharashtra.

In summary, a large (reversed) question mark-shaped skin incision based at the ear will be made. A bone flap with a diameter of at least 12 cm (including the frontal, parietal, temporal and parts of the occipital squama) will be removed. Additional temporal bone will be removed so that the floor of the middle cerebral fossa can be explored. The dura will be opened and an augmented dural patch, consisting of either homologous periost and/or temporal fascia, or lyophylised cadaver dura, will be inserted. The dura will be fixed at the margin of the craniotomy to prevent epidural bleeding. The temporal muscle and the skin flap will then be re-approximated and secured. Infarcted brain tissue will not be resected. A sensor for registration of intracranial pressure may be inserted. In surviving patients, cranioplasty will be performed after at least 6 weeks, using the stored bone flap or an artificial bone flap. After surgery, patients will be transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The complete procedure is documented on video for post protocol analysis. \n\nConservative treatment: So far no mode of treatment of raised intracranial pressure has been proven to be superior to another. So treatment options listed here may vary from one institution to another. However, as much consistency of treatment between the centres as possible should be given. Therefore the following treatment modalities are given (the following protocol has been worked out by Dr M\u00fcnch [Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg] and Dr J\u00fcttler [Department of Neurology, University of Heidelberg] including the latest recommendations in neurological intensive care, stroke therapy and anesthesiological intensive care medicine and has been approved by all participating anesthesiological and neurological intensive care physicians):\n\n1. Osmotherapy: osmotherapy should be started immediately after randomisation. The use of mannitol (i.e. Osmofundin 100 ml 15% solution 4 times per day) or glycerol (i.e. Glycerosteril 250 ml 10% solution, 4 times per day) is recommended. Dosage depends on serum osmolality and should reach 315 to 320 mOsm.\n2. Intubation and mechanical ventilation: Patients will be intubated at a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) lower than 8, or if there are any signs of respiratory insufficiency (pO2 <60 mmHg, pCO2 >48 mmHg), or if the airway is compromised. However, earlier intubation is left at the discretion of the treating physician. The same goes for ventilation mode. The following parameters should be reached: pO2 >75 mmHg, pCO2 36-44 mmHg. In case of raised intracranial pressure the ventilation mode is changed to a frequency of 35 and pO2 >100 mmHg. \n3. Hyperventilation: The use of hyperventilation is discouraged in the early phase of treatment. In the case of further neurological deterioration and/or uncontrolled increase in intracranial pressure, hyperventilation may be started as ultima ratio. If hyperventilation is started, it is advised to monitor venous oxygenation with jugular bulb oxymetry and to maintain saturation higher than 50%. If venous oxygen saturation is not monitored, the pCO2 may be reduced to 28-32 mmHg.\n4. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring: The mode of invasive monitoring of the intracranial pressure is left at the discretion of the treating physician. If used, measurement should be performed in the ipsilateral side.\n5. Sedation: The mode of sedation is left at the discretion of the treating physician. If sedation is required because of mechanical ventilation, further neurological deterioration, or uncontrolled increase of intracranial pressure, patients should be sedated with propofol. The use of barbiturates is discouraged because they may reduce cerebral perfusion pressure and often do not lead to sustained control of intracranial pressure. The use of muscle relaxants is left at the discretion of the treating physician.\n6. Blood pressure control: blood pressure is controlled according to the latest recommendations of the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (Hacke et al. 2000). Recommended blood pressure in formerly hypertensive patients is 180/100-105 mmHg and in formerly normotensive patients 160-180/90-100 mmHg. The use of catecholamines or antihypertensive drugs is left at the discretion of the treating physician. An exception is made in patients receiving decompressive surgery. In these cases blood pressure during the postoperative phase of the first 8 hours after surgery is kept at 140-160 mmHg to avoid severe bleedings.\n7. Positioning: elevation of the head 30 degrees\n8. Body core temperature: normothermia should be reached. Therefore elevated body temperature is treated as soon as it exceeds 37.5 \u00b0C (Hacke et al. 2000). The use of antipyretics, external cooling or intravasal cooling is left at the discretion of the treating physician.\n9. Blood glucose level: according to the latest recommendations of the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (Hacke et al. 2000) and recommendations of intensive care medicine (van den Berghe et al. 2001) blood glucose level should not exceed 140 mg/dl, 8 mmol/l, respectively. The parameter that should be reached is 80-110 mg/dl. Insulin should be used for control of blood glucose level. Hypoglycemia is treated with 10% or 20% glucose.\n10.  Hemoglobin concentration should be >10 g/dl (Hb >10 g/dl)\n11.  Prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis is done with low-molecular-weight heparin (i.e. Fragmin once a day)\n\nAll treatment on the ICU is documented for post protocol analysis.", "interventionType": "Procedure/Surgery", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2007 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17690310 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "1f273ad8-edf7-4748-926e-6314cb5bfa55", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2007-09-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17690310"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder13541-0", "contactId": "Contact51202_13541", "sponsorId": "Sponsor49601"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51202_13541", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Stefan", "surname": "Schwab", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Im Neuenheimer Feld 400", "city": "Heidelberg", "country": "Germany", "zip": "D-69120", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+49 (0)62 2156 7504"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "stefan_schwab@med.uni-heidelberg.de"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor49601", "organisation": "University of Heidelberg (Germany)", "website": "http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=600", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Neurology\nIm Neuenheimer Feld 400", "city": "Heidelberg", "country": "Germany", "zip": "D-69120", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+49 (0)62 2156 8211"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "werner_hacke@med.uni-heidelberg.de"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.7700.0", "rorId": "https://ror.org/038t36y30"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder13541-0", "name": "University of Heidelberg (Germany) - Department of Neurology", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2010-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "24", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2006-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "69736659"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Randomised controlled trial of restrictive versus routine use of episiotomy for instrumental delivery - a multicentre pilot study", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "Aim to assess the effects of restrictive use of episiotomy compared with routine use during instrumental vaginal delivery", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Third or fourth degree perineal tears", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

The importance of breathing awareness is emphasised and massage techniques are taught, synchronising them with breathing and visualisation. They are asked to practise this programme, with the help of a video, for at least 3 evenings a week, for about 30-45 minutes, until 39 weeks and then a combination of techniques every evening, until hospital admission for labour/induction. During labour in hospital, the intervention is supported by a self-selected group of midwives, who have successfully completed an accredited massage course and attended one information session on the needs and expectations of women in the placebo arm of the trial.\n\nPlacebo: Breathing/Visualisation\nIt is possible that the addition of an extra antenatal class specifically devoted to coping with pain in labour will improve outcomes for women in the Massage group regardless of the use of massage. Therefore, this \"placebo\" group will be included as a second comparision to test whether additional social support in the massage group accounts for any observed difference. Couples receive an additional antenatal class devoted to coping with labour, which offers breathing techniques and visualisation, without the use of massage. They are asked to practise this programme, for at least 3 evenings a week, for about 30-45 minutes, until 39 weeks and then a combination of techniques every evening until hospital admission for labour/induction. During labour in hospital, the intervention is supported by a self-selected group of midwives, who have successfully completed an accredited massage course and attended one information session on the needs and expectations of women in the placebo arm of the trial.\n\nControl: Usual care\nThe women and companions in this group will be asked to attend the usual antenatal preparation classes that are currently available at the trial site. At present there are 4 two-hour classes.\n\nBlinding to such visibly different options will not be possible. However, information offered to women will focus on the use of complementary strategies for coping with pain, rather than focusing only on the use of massage and will not emphasise, or imply superiority of, one form of care over another. Instead current lack of knowledge about what helps women to cope with labour will be emphasised. The use of a Placebo group guards against the potentially confounding factor of additional information, social support and other non-pharmacological strategies for pain management.\nA self-selected group of trained midwives will care for women in all three arms of the trial. This has been done to ensure that:\n1. All participants are cared for by professionals who have achieved the same level of knowledge and competence\n2.

This study will examine the impact of a dedicated 'work placement co-ordinator' on the access to work opportunities of 1000 patients currently in the care of secondary mental health services in two inner London Boroughs.  The intervention will be compared to standard care using random allocation between 10 sector teams.  The intervention consists of a training package on work placement for the team members and on-going team access to a vocational counsellor for advice.  Outcome will be measured by improvements in individual patient activity at one year.  Patient predictors of response to the intervention will be sought.  Improvement in work activity is of direct benefit to individual patients in terms of self esteem and in stemming clinical and social deterioration.  It has also been shown to reduce carer burden, thereby addressing the NHS's commitment to the needs of families and carers.  Work activity may also reduce relapse rate in the longer term and may save on inpatient bed pressure.

Brief assessment by questionnaire followed by a detailed assessment including visual acuity for all patients (the intervention group for this study) - the universal screening group.\n\nIn the brief assessment, as one of the 35 questions about their health, participants were asked the following question on vision: 'Do you have difficulty seeing newsprint, even if you are wearing glasses?'  \nIn arm A, criteria for triggering to the detailed assessment were three or more problems identified from the brief assessment or any one of four 'serious' symptoms (unexpected weight loss, frequent falls in previous month, vomiting blood, coughing blood).  \nIn arm B all participants had a detailed assessment.  In the detailed assessment, the participants' distance visual acuity was measured using a logarithm of the minimum\nangle of resolution (logMAR) chart. Anyone with a pinhole corrected acuity of 0.5 or more (equivalent to Snellen acuity less than 6/18) was referred to an ophthalmologist.  If the visual impairment was corrected by use of a pinhole, the participant was referred to an optometrist for refractive error correction.\n\nThe patient assessments described above began in 1995 and were completed at the end of 1998.  All participants are being followed up for mortality and hospital admissions but are not being re-examined as part of the MRC Elderly Screening Trial.
