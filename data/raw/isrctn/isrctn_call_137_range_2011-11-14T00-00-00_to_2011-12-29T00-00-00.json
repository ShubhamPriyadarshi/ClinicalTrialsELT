According to the Cochrane meta-analysis performed by the routine ultrasound performed beyond 24 weeks gestation does not provide benefits. We interpret the studies in the context in which they were designed. Most of them differ very much in the way we act today. In addition some studies do not change the action in the diagnosis of foetal growth restriction and have no impact on perinatal outcomes, other studies if they introduce more measures to control welfare and suggest that non-detection of growth retardation leads to greater mobility and mortality. The foetuses with growth restriction have an increased risk of perinatal complications, neonatal and during adulthood. What has not been identified even if it is more sensitive at 36 than at 32 weeks following the current guidelines on gestational control.\n\nThe sensitivity for detection of ultrasound foetus small for gestational age (FPEG) third quarter unselected population of pregnant women is 20% higher if they perform at 36 to 32 weeks of gestation.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Measurements of biparietal diameter (BPD), were obtained from a transverse axial plane of the foetal head showing a central mid-line echo broken in the anterior third by the cavum septii pellucidi and demonstrating the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles. BPD was measured from the outer borders of the skull. The hemisphere was measured from the mid-line to the inner border of the skull.\n2. Chest circumference (CC) was measured in the same axial plane, outside the bone\n3. The femur length (FL) was measured from the greater trochanter to the lateral condyle\n4. For abdominal circumference (AC), a transverse section of the fetal abdomen was taken at the level of the stomach and the bifurcation of the main portal vein into its right and left branches\nAll the measurements were performed on two occasions, and avaerage was calculated.

Most cases are pneumonia and the majority occur among poor children under five years in developing countries. Poverty might be said to be the primary cause, which manifests as malnutrition, including micro-nutrient deficiencies, and lack of access to medical care. Another attribute of poverty is household indoor air pollution (HAP) from use of unprocessed solid fuels such as biomass (wood, animal dung and crop wastes) and coal in simple stoves. A meta-analysis of published observational studies found that young children exposed to smoke from household solid fuel use had a rate of ALRI twice that of children not exposed or where clean fuels were used. Recent studies have shown similar ALRI risks associated with short-term air pollution measurements and other indicators of exposure. \n\nThe substantial indoor concentrations of important health-damaging pollutants which result from the use of these fuels are thought to explain the relationship with ALRI. As with tobacco smoke, there are thousands of compounds in gaseous and aerosol forms found in biomass fuel smoke, including dozens with effects that include immune system suppression, severe irritation, inflammation, cilia toxicity, and carcinogenicity. Small particles are typically used as an indicator of the health risk for these mixtures, and in households using biomass fuels without effective chimneys are typically found in concentrations 10 to 100 times higher than health-based guidelines. \n\nViral agents play an important role in ALRI, although it is thought that most deaths occur through bacterial infection, which may occur with or without initial viral infection. Of the viral agents, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common, although its importance varies by season. Evidence to date about the relationship between solid fuel smoke pollution and risk of RSV illness, is conflicting. One study from the Gambia reported reduced risk of severe RSV illness with higher exposure to cooking smoke, raising the possibility of a differential effect on viral and bacterial ALRI. \n \nThe evidence from existing studies of ALRI risk associated with solid fuel use is limited by a range of methodological issues. All used observational designs which carry the inherent difficulty of residual confounding from the association between solid fuels and other poverty-related ALRI risk factors, particularly nutrition. Studies used a mix of hospital and community-based case-finding: those using the latter will have had particular difficulty distinguishing lower respiratory tract infections from acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURI). This is important as the more common AURI may have a quite different relationship with air pollution, and is not responsible for significant morbidity or mortality. Since few studies have assessed indicators of ALRI severity (e.g. hypoxaemia), and none has attempted to differentiate all ALRI by aetiologic agent (viral versus bacterial), it has not been possible to assess the impact of HAP on factors known to increase case fatality. Almost none of the studies carried out pollution assessment, relying instead on indirect exposure indicators such as fuel or stove type, or whether a child is carried on the mother's back during cooking - methods which are inevitably associated with substantial exposure misclassification. Finally, lack of blinding may have led to bias.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Physician-diagnosed pneumonia in children through 18 months of age. Pneumonia case finding and management were based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) Strategy, developed by World Health Organization (WHO)/United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). This approach was selected because:\n1. Experience has demonstrated that locally recruited field staff can be trained to assess ALRI and other common conditions using this method\n2. In terms of case definition, it is sufficiently valid and consistent with most other recent population-based field studies of ALRI\n3. There are well developed training materials and procedures for both case finding and management\n4. It integrates case finding with clinically effective management of sick children\n\nChild health outcomes were assessed through weekly home visits by trained field workers, with referral to study physicians working in local community centres to maintain blindness to interventions status for clinical examination. Follow-up of children were from age at initial recruitment (birth to 4 months) until they reached 18 months of age. The fieldworkers, trained in IMCI, assessed and identified all children with rapid breathing, in addition to other signs of ALRI and the WHO-defined general danger signs. The rationale for carrying out the home visits at weekly intervals was based on the duration of pneumonia, in particular the duration of visible signs (principally fast breathing and chest indrawing). Estimates of this vary and depend on definitions of when an episode finishes. Weekly visits allowed almost all cases of ALRI to be identified through direct observation of the sick child, with a minority by mother's recall of the most relevant signs. Maternal recall of these signs does not have a high sensitivity and specificity, and was kept to a minimum.\n \nChildren meeting criteria for possible ALRI (or other significant illness) were referred to one of the study doctors who carried out a clinical examination including pulse oximetry. All children with a diagnosis of pneumonia were offered a direct antigen test for RSV, and a chest X-ray). Chest X-rays were carried out initially at San Marcos Hospital and subsequently at a private clinic to ensure quality control, normally within 24 - 48 hours of the initial assessment by the study doctor, subject to parental consent. All X-rays images were stored (scanned), and read by independent reviewers, blind to intervention status, using WHO training software and procedures. Children meeting the criteria for referral to hospital were admitted (subject to parental consent) to San Marcos hospital. All children admitted with suspected pneumonia received a chest X-ray, as per usual practice at this hospital. All children diagnosed with ALRI or other severe conditions by study MDs were offered free treatment under normal medical protocols.\n\nDefinition of new episodes:  \nNew episodes were defined, drawing on current practice for ALRI field studies, as follows:\n1. A sick child meeting the criteria for ALRI less than 15 days after apparent recovery from an earlier episode is regarded as a relapse of the first episode\n2. A sick child meeting the ALRI criteria 15 or more days after apparent recovery from an earlier episode is regarded as a new episode\n\nSeverity: \nThe severity of the illness as determined by field workers was categorised according to the symptoms and signs included in the IMCI algorithm. Severe FW-cases were those with chest indrawing and/or the most reliably described general danger sign, that is inability to breast-feed or drink. Severity of all physician-diagnosed outcomes was determined by the level of oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry. A cut off of 87% was taken, based on the established definition of this being 2 standard deviations below the mean level for a representative group of well children in the study sample. The relatively low level reflects the altitude of the study site (mean 2,600 metres).", "secondaryOutcome": "Derived from the case finding methods described above:\n1.

It is estimated that AMD affects approximately 1.4 million individuals in United States, 417,000 people in the United Kingdom and 70,000 people in the Republic of Ireland, and this number is likely to increase due to increasing longevity. Although the aetiological mechanisms leading to ARM are uncertain, there is a growing consensus that cumulative short wavelength (blue) light damage and/or oxidative stress play a role in this disease.\n\nThe central retina, known as the macula, is responsible for central, colour and fine-detail vision. A pigment, composed of the three dietary hydroxycarotenoids, lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z), and meso-zeaxanthin (MZ) (MZ is also formed in the retina following conversion from L), accumulates at the macula where it is known as macular pigment (MP). MP is a blue light filter and a powerful antioxidant, and is therefore believed to protect against ARM. In addition, there is good reason to believe why supplementation with L, Z and MZ would enhance a patient\u0092s retinal sensitivity. \n\nSeveral studies have investigated the relationship between dietary and serum concentrations of L (and Z) and MP optical density in humans, and all have demonstrated a positive relationship between these variables. Non-dietary variables suspected of acting as determinants of serum concentrations of L (and Z) and/or MP optical density include: age; sex; iris colour; race; body fat; ultraviolet light exposure; tobacco and drinking habits; and genetic background. However, the exclusively dietary origins of L and Z suggest that dietary intake (fruit and vegetables and/or dietary supplements) of these carotenoids represents one of the most important determinants of serum L (and Z) and MP optical density. \n\nTo date, there have been several published studies in the literature reporting on L and/or Z supplementation with respect to serum carotenoid and MP levels, in human subjects. However, there has only been one study which has investigated the effects of supplemental MZ and that study consisted of only 10 subjects and nine controls which were recruited in a non-randomized manner. MZ is a particularly interesting macular carotenoid for the following reasons. MZ is the dominant carotenoid in the central fovea: of the three macular carotenoids, MZ is the most powerful antioxidant; MZ facilities a wider range of blue light filtration; at an anatomic level, MZ is more closely related to vulnerable photoreceptors than either L or Z, and is therefore ideally located to afford protection against free radical damage. \n\nGiven that there are many factors which affect the bioavailability and uptake of MZ, L and Z into the retina, it is possible that other commercially available products designed to augment MP, such as Macushield\u2122, may show a more favorable response than previously tested formulations. We believe that the ideal formulation to augment MP would contain all three of the macular carotenoids (MZ, L, and Z), primarily because all other commercially available products (at least in the context of a typical diet which does not include MZ-containing foods, such a shrimp and salmon) depends on the individual\u0092s ability to convert L to MZ within the retina, and this process may well be dependent on specific enzymatic isomerisations. In other words, MacuShield\u2122 (because it contains MZ) is the only formulation which provides all three macular carotenoids, without the need for conversion of any of these compounds within the retina. \n\nIn addition, the design of all studies to date are limited, as no study has yet investigated supplementation of any of the macular carotenoids in ARM subjects in a double-blind randomised controlled fashion. Also, all supplementation studies to date have reported only on the peak MP optical density. This is a major limitation, due to the fact that most of the studies to date would have supplemented with L only, and it is known that L accumulates in the periphery of the MP and not at the centre where these measurements would have been made. In other words, it is likely that previous studies reporting on L supplementation with respect to MP levels would have missed (or were unable to detect) significant increases in peripheral MP levels. In brief, therefore, a properly designed study capable of investigating MZ, L and Z supplementation with respect to serum and MP levels (including its entire spatial profile), in patients with ARM is truly merited and will accredit any MP product which is tested in this manner. \n\nFurthermore, as there are now many different carotenoid-based products available on the market, with various different formulations and concentrations of the macular carotenoids, it is timely, therefore, to compare patient response (in serum and macula) to such formulations. In this way, suffers of ARM, and people at risk of developing this disease, will be informed as to which product provides the greater augmentation of serum and retinal levels of the macular carotenoids following supplementation with these compounds. \n\nThis study is designed to compare two different carotenoid-based products, in a double-blind, randomised controlled fashion, with respect to changes in MP optical density, and in serum concentrations of MZ, L and Z. This study will also investigate whether MP augmentation enhances visual performance in AMD patients.\n\nA predecessor to this trial has been registered with an ISRCTN and can be found at http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN60816411; this previously registered trial was performed in a population of normal healthy participants where the primary outcome measure was macular and serum responses to Macushield\u2122.

It is estimated that AMD affects approximately 1.4 million individuals in the United States, 417,000 people in the United Kingdom and 70,000 people in the Republic of Ireland, and this number is likely to increase due to increasing longevity. Although the aetiological mechanisms leading to AMD are uncertain, there is a growing consensus that cumulative short wavelength (blue) light damage and/or oxidative stress play a role.\n\nThe central retina, known as the macula, is responsible for central, colour and fine-detail vision. A pigment, composed of the three dietary hydroxycarotenoids, meso-zeaxanthin (MZ), lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) (MZ is also formed in the retina following conversion from L), accumulates at the macula where it is known as macular pigment (MP). MP is a blue light filter and a powerful antioxidant, and is therefore believed to protect against AMD. In addition, there is good reason to believe why supplementation with MZ, L and Z would enhance a patient's retinal sensitivity.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the relationship between dietary and serum concentrations of L (and Z) and MP optical density in humans, and all have demonstrated a positive relationship between these variables. Non-dietary variables suspected of acting as determinants of serum concentrations of L (and Z) and/or MP optical density include: age; sex; iris colour; race; body fat; ultraviolet light exposure; cumulative visible light exposure; tobacco and drinking habits; and genetic background. However, the exclusively dietary origins of L and Z suggest that dietary intake (fruit and vegetables and/or dietary supplements) of these carotenoids represents one of the most important determinants of serum L (and Z) and MP optical density.\n\nTo date, there have been several published studies in the literature reporting on L and/or Z supplementation with respect to serum carotenoid and MP levels, in human subjects. In 1997, Hammond et al. showed that dietary modification, for as little as four weeks, could augment MP, with this effect being maintained for several months following resumption of a normal, unmodified diet. Of note, two of the 11 subjects involved in that study did not show a significant rise in MP optical density despite a significant increase in serum L. These subjects were termed \"retinal non-responders\" and this phenomenon may be due to a compromised ability to capture and/or stabilise the macular carotenoids in these individuals. Landrum et al. investigated the effect of L supplementation in two individuals over a 140 day period. They found an increase in serum L levels in both individuals, coupled with a parallel increase in MP optical density. Most recently, a study by Trieschmann et al.  concluded that supplementation with 12 mg L and 1 mg Z, combined with co-antioxidants, resulted in a significant increase in MP optical density in a majority of subjects. However, there has only been one study which has investigated the effects of supplemental MZ and that study consisted of only 10 subjects and nine controls which were recruited in a non-randomised manner. MZ is a particularly interesting macular carotenoid for the following reasons:\n1. MZ is the dominant carotenoid in the central fovea: of the three macular carotenoids, MZ is the most powerful antioxidant in the presence of its binding protein\n2. MZ facilitates a wider range of blue light filtration\n3. At an anatomic level, MZ is more closely related to vulnerable photoreceptors than either L or Z, and is therefore ideally located to afford protection against free radical damage.\n\nIn addition, the design of all studies to date are limited, as no study has yet investigated supplementation of any macular carotenoid in subjects using a double-blind randomised placebo controlled design. Also, all supplementation studies to date have reported only on the peak MP optical density. This is a major limitation, due to the fact that most of the studies to date would have supplemented with L only, and it is known that L accumulates in the periphery of the MP and not at the centre where these measurements would have been made. In other words, it is likely that previous studies reporting on L supplementation with respect to MP levels would have missed (or were unable to detect) significant increases in peripheral MP levels. In brief, therefore, a properly designed study capable of investigating MZ, L and Z supplementation with respect to serum and MP levels (including its entire spatial profile), in human subjects is truly merited.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate (in a double-blind, randomised placebo controlled fashion) changes in MP optical density (including its entire spatial profile), and in serum concentrations of MZ, L and Z, in response to supplementation with MacuShield\u2122/MacuHealth with LMZ (a specialised, comprehensive formula of MZ, L and Z) in normal subjects, and investigate whether MP augmentation in such subjects enhances retinal sensitivity.\n\nPlease note that, as of 21/01/2009, the public title of this trial has been amended from \"Human response to Macushield\u2122/MacuHealth with LMZ\" to \"Meso-zeaxanthin Ocular Supplementation Trial (MOST)\".

An independent observer (blind to the subject's randomisation) will, after consent is signed, collect the baseline data, undertake the tests for exercise capacity, the measurements for posture and chest wall mobility, and administer the qualitative questionnaires for pain and for quality of life related to physical functioning. \n4.The independent observer will then undertake repeated measurements of lung function, exercise capacity, posture, chest wall mobility, and administer the qualitative questionnaires for pain and for quality of life related to physical functioning for all subjects at week three, six and twelve.\n5. Full lung function tests will be undertaken in the Lung Function Laboratory (with the physiologist blind to the subject's randomisation) at baseline and after the six-week treatment period. When possible the subject's annual review lung function data will be used as the baseline measurement, to avoid duplication of these tests.\n6.

Aged greater than 70 years\n2. A history or symptoms of angina pectoris\n3. A history of myocardial infarction (history and/or presence of Q-wave on Electrocardiogram [ECG])\n4. A history of congestive heart failure\n5. Diabetes mellitus\n6. Renal dysfunction (serum creatinine greater than 180 \u00b5mol/l), or \n7. A history of cerebrovascular accident. \nThe value of each cardiac risk factor is the same.\n\nIn all patients without the above risk factors, and those with one or two risk factors, NT-proBNP concentrations are measured. Those with a normal test are referred for surgery without additional testing. \n\nPatients with an abnormal NT-proBNP concentration of greater than 350 pg/ml will be referred for non-invasive cardiac imaging. Imaging tests will assess Left Ventricular (LV) function at rest, the presence of a pressure gradient over the aortic valve, and the presence and extent of stress-induced ischaemia.\n\nIn all high-risk patients, those with three or more risk factors, NT-proBNP concentrations are measured. Routinely, all patients will be referred for additional testing for the evaluation of LV function at rest, the presence of a pressure gradient over the aortic valve, and the presence and extent of stress-induced ischaemia.\n\nMyocardial ischaemia: \nPatients without ischaemia as well as those with limited ischaemia are referred for surgery with beta-blocker therapy. In patients with extensive ischaemia, the treating physician will decide further perioperative care. This may be: \n1. Cancellation of surgery, a limited procedure, or endovascular repair \n2. Surgery with optimal medical cardio-protection, or \n3. Prophylactic coronary revascularisation\nThe type of coronary revascularisation, bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, is decided by the treating physicians on the basis of coronary anatomy and the possible delay of the index surgical procedure. \n\nLeft ventricular failure: \nCurrently no specific guidelines exist on perioperative management in patients with heart failure. Heart failure has important long-term prognostic value and the decision to continue with surgery can rejected because of this unexpected finding. The attending physicians take this decision.\n\nAortic valve stenosis: \nA mean gradient of 40 mmHg or more is associated with an increased perioperative cardiac event rate. The presence of aortic valve stenosis will influence perioperative anaesthesiological care and haemodynamic management. In selected cases preoperative valve replacement can be considered.\n\nBeta-blocker therapy: \nAll patients are on perioperative beta-blocker therapy. In patients without beta-blockers, bisoprolol 2.5 mg once a day is started at the screening visit. Patients on chronic beta-blocker therapy continued their medication. Beta-blocker dose will be adjusted in all patients at admission to the hospital and on the day prior to surgery to achieve a resting heart frequency of 60 - 65 beats per minute. In case of symptoms or markers of myocardial ischaemia accompanied by tachycardia during surgery occurs, additional beta-blocker therapy is administrated. The same dose of beta-blockers will be continued postoperatively except in patients who were unable to take medication orally or by nasogastric tube postoperatively. In these patients, the heart rate is monitored continuously in the intensive care unit or hourly at the ward, and intravenous metoprolol is administered at a dose sufficient to keep the heart rate between 60 - 65 beats per minute. The heart rate and blood pressure are measured immediately before each scheduled dose of beta-blockers. Beta-blockers are withheld if the heart rate was under 50 beats per minute or the systolic blood pressure was under 100 mmHg.\n\nStatin and anticoagulant therapy: \nAll patients are on perioperative statin therapy. Patients on chronic statin therapy continue their medication. Statin dose is not intensified prior to surgery for reduction of serum cholesterol levels. The same dose of statins will be continued as soon as possible after surgery, either by mouth or nasogastric tube. Statins are withheld if liver dysfunctions occur, defined as an Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) elevations of three-times the upper limit of normal.\n\nAnticoagulant and antiplatelet after percutaneous coronary intervention are continued during surgery.", "interventionType": "Procedure/Surgery", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder16401-0", "contactId": "Contact54359_16401", "sponsorId": "Sponsor52913"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact54359_16401", "title": "Prof", "forename": "D", "surname": "Poldermans", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Erasmus Medical Centre \nDepartment of Anesthesiology", "city": "Rotterdam", "country": "Netherlands", "zip": "3015 GD", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+31 (0)10 463 4613"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "d.poldermans@erasmusmc.nl"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor52913", "organisation": "Erasmus Medical Centre (The Netherlands)", "website": "http://www.erasmusmc.nl/", "sponsorType": "Hospital/treatment centre", "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Anesthesiology\nP.O.

The principle source of H2S in the colon is from the conversion of sulphate to sulfide by bacteria. Other sources of H2S production include the fermentation of proteins of animal and plant origin. The majority of dietary sulphate is absorbed in the small intestine with relatively small amounts entering the colon. Intestinal transit speed is known to influence the absorption and breakdown of many dietary substances. In particular intestinal transit speed alters the colonic bacterial flora and fermentation of food. The purpose of this study is to look at the influence of intestinal transit time on the metabolism of sulphate as no data exist.

Patients treated with Combivir\u00ae will receive one tablet twice a day: Lamivudine 150 mg and Zidovudine 300 mg twice a day. Those patients not on ursodeoxycholic acid at the start of the study will be treated with ursodeoxycholic acid at the dose indicated for a period of 6 months prior to randomisation to ursodeoxycholic acid alone or in combination with Combivir\u00ae twice a day.\n\nAt enrolment, each patient with PBC will be assessed for the inclusion criteria. Prior to therapy, patients will have a thorough history taken to assess symptoms. An objective graded clinical parameter scale will include the development, presence or worsening of pruritus, fatigue, sicca syndrome or right upper quadrant pain. At the same time patients will be examined for the presence or development of overt clinical signs such as jaundice, splenomegaly or hepatomegaly.

All of these are laboratory assessments that are clinically useful in following patients with PBC.\n\nUnless problems develop in the interim, patients will be seen at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 after initiation of therapy. At the initial clinic visit, blood will be drawn for BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, amylase, bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, PT, serum lactate and FBC. Subsequently, samples will be drawn for hepatic biochemistry, as well as virological and immunological studies. Patients will undergo a physical exam at each visit and also be questioned about changes in symptoms. Liver biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated.\n\nResponse to therapy will be based on changes in symptomatology, development of overt clinical signs, immunological parameters, improvement of liver function and biochemistry.
