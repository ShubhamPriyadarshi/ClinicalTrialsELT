Especially when under the treatment condition of testosterone with sildenafil. In addition, we will investigate the effects of testosterone in combination with sildenafil on vaginal and subjective sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli in females with Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) and control subjects, for individual motivational and emotional differences (valence). In earlier study's we've found a distinction between groups that differ in colour naming of erotic words compared to neutral words. These two groups also differed in their benefit from testosterone combined with sildenafil. \n\nWe expect that for some women this treatment, testosterone with sildenafil will work adequately. For the other group, we expect that negative sexual experiences and personality differences and therefore the negative/defensive motivational neural circuit is responsible for the more diffuse reaction to the treatment of testosterone and sildenafil, in women with FSD.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Evaluation of the women's judgment of valence (negative or positive) for erotic stimuli under placebo condition and the condition of 0.5 mg sublingual testosterone combined with sildenafil (50 mg) and the influence of positive and/or negative valence on attention for erotic cues, in healthy female subjects with and without Female Sexual Dysfunction. \n\nData for analysis:\n1. Attention for erotic stimuli (strooptask: speedrate). A masked version of the Emotional Stroop Task comparing colour-naming latencies on neutral and erotic words will be used. The word is presented before and after the erotic film excerpts in the attention condition for about 24 ms and then masked by randomly cut, reassembled signs in the same colour (red, green, yellow or blue). The colour of the mask has to be assigned, and subjects are asked to verbally name the colours as quickly as possible. The stimuli are presented in the centre of the screen. An extra set of stimuli will be prepared for practice-trials. A trial consists of a fixation point, which will be shown for 750 ms, followed by the target stimulus (the coloured neutral or erotic word and mask). Vocal responses will be recorded and will terminate the trials. The order of these 2 blocks will be randomly assigned. Attention will be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose).\n2. Vaginal Pulse Amplitude (VPA. A vaginal photoplethysmograph will be used to measure Vaginal Pulse Amplitude (VPA) (the AC component of the signal), which is a reliable index for genital vasocongestion. Changes in the amplitude of the signal reflect changes in vaginal vasocongestion. The Vaginal Photoplethysmograph (VP) is a clean tampon shaped device, which contains an infrared Light-Emitting Diode (LED) as a light source and a photosensitive light detector (photodiode). It measures the blood volume in the tissue surrounding the plethysmograph. The light emitted by the LED is reflected by the blood vessels in the tissue. This light is measured by the photodiode. The output signal of the photodiode varies with changes in the amount of blood in the vessels. VPA will be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose)\n3. Valence for erotic stimuli. Perceived emotional valence of erotic stimuli will be measured and compared to neutral, pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Facial expressions reveal emotions with corresponding appetitive and defensive motivational circuits. The amygdala projects to the facial motor nucleus, which reflects the chosen motivational circuit; appetitive or defensive. Therefore, Electromyographic (EMG) activity will be measured over the corrugator, zygomatic major and orbicularis oculi muscles. Activation of the zygomatic muscle reveals a smile, but co-activation of the zygomatic and orbicularis mirrors a major smile. Activation of the corrugator muscle alone is correlated with viewing unpleasant events. More specifically, co-activation of the corrugator and orbicularis oculi reflects the emotion of repulsion and aversion. While viewing International Affective Picture System (IAPS) pictures (eight pictures for each domain; pleasant, neutral, unpleasant and erotic) and an additional category of sexually explicit pictures (depicting vaginal coitus), activation of the three muscles will be measured two seconds before picture onset and for six seconds during picture presentation. The activation of the orbicularis oculi muscle is also a component of the startle reflex. When viewing the pictures, half of all pictures will be accompanied by a startle stimulus. The acoustic startle stimulus consists of a 50-ms burst of white noise, presented at 95 dB. The startle stimuli will be presented through earplugs, between 3 and 5 seconds following picture onset. Prior to the first block, six startle sounds will be presented to allow habituation of the startle reflex. After the presentation of the pictures subjects are instructed to give a subjective rating of the emotional pictures by finger pointing at a touch screen. Each emotional picture will be followed by a picture of five figures with expressions ranging from happy (smiling) to unhappy (frowning). Subjects are instructed to rate on a 9-point scale how their feeling towards the preceding picture was reflected by one of the figures. The same was done for arousal, with excited, wide-eyed figures to sleepy, relaxed figures. Valence be measured on both the experimental days in the morning (pre-dose) and in the afternoon (post-dose).", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

Letrozole has also been shown to be more effective than tamoxifen in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Recently, anastrozole has been shown to induce a reduction in the rate of relapse as compared with tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting. Extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole after 5 years tamoxifen has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of recurrence and to improve significantly the disease\u0096free survival of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. International studies are investigating the effect of letrozole compared to tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer patients. Few Asian patients are included. A large number of early breast cancer patients in Thailand are currently being treated with tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment.\nIt is not yet clear whether aromatase inhibitor can replace tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer. Sequence and timing of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor treatment in adjuvant treatment still needs to be determined as well.\nThe goals of this study are the following:\n1. To determine whether the replacement, as adjuvant therapy, of tamoxifen by letrozole for the last 3 years of a standard 5 year treatment period can reduce the risk of treatment failure in early breast cancer patients\n2. To conduct this study in a Thai population\n3. To compare the 2 treatments in terms of safety and tolerability\n\nApproximately 1000 patients from up to 15 centers across Thailand will be enrolled into this study.

immunogenicity studies using conjugate Pnc and Hib vaccines in the Gambia, we propose to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 7-valent Pnc conjugate (4, 6B, 9V 14 18C 19F 23F) manufactured by Wyeth Lederle Vaccine USA, using different vaccination schedules. The aim is to determine whether fewer doses started earlier in life with or without a booster dose of Pnc polysaccharide can induce a protective antibody response throughout infancy and early childhood. 675 young infants, residing in sites where the large efficacy (Pnc) trial is on-going, will be randomly allocated to one of 3 vaccination schedules using the 7-valent conjugate vaccine to assess the magnitude, duration and quality of the antibody- response to 1-2 doses with or without a booster dose in Upper River Division of The Gambia. The impact of this vaccination schedule on carriage of pneumococci will also be determined.\n\nThe data from this immunogenicity study and the larger on-going efficacy trial could provide important data for an informed policy decision in developing countries. We propose to use 7-valent vaccine since it is licensed and available, but would be guided by WHO as to the suitability and availability of other possible conjugate vaccines.\n\nGeneral objectives:\nEvaluating the safety and antibody response to 1 or 2 doses of 7-valent conjugate  pneumococcal (Pnc) vaccine given early in life with a booster dose of polysaccharide, compared with a standard 3-dose regimen. \n\nSpecific primary objectives:\n1. To determine the immunogenicity of a 7-valent Pnc Conjugate vaccine at ages 18 weeks and 9 months, after one, two and three doses of conjugate vaccines\n2. To evaluate the secondary immune response (antibody) to Pnc polysaccharide vaccine at age 10 months after one, two or three doses of 7-valent conjugate vaccine\n\nSecondary objectives:\n1. To evaluate persistence of antibody at age 15 months\n2. To evaluate evidence of memory response following Conjugate vaccines using assays of antibody avidity and affinity\n3.
