Afterwards all participants had to be followed up till day 21 after inclusion. During whole study period all patients (or their parents) had to keep a diary recording either intensity of 8 symptoms ((headache, muscle ache, chilliness, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) using a 4-point scale (during first 9 days) or answering a question whether they had any symptoms of common cold (during days 8-21). Additionally, at Visit 1 (day 1) and 2 (days 3-4) nasal fluid was collected. After study end duration of disease, intensity of symptoms over time and viral load in nasal fluid was compared in groups receiving carrageenan spray treatment and placebo.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThere was no immediate benefit for study participants; however, there was possible future benefit for society resulting from development new safe and effective therapy for common cold.\nNo significant risks were anticipated.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nSt. Anna Children\u00b4s Hospital (Vienna, Austria)\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nThis study was running from 2st January, 2009 (initiation) till 23 December, 2009 (close-out).\n\nWho is funding the study?\nMarinomed Biotechnologie GmbH, Vienna, Austria\n\nWho is main contact?\nDr Tamas Fazekas\ntamas.fazekas@stanna.at", "primaryOutcome": "The primary efficacy variable was the total symptom score (TSS) (sum of 8 symptoms), mean of study days 2-7.\nDefinition of TSS:\nSum of 8 individual symptom scores (headache, muscle ache, chilliness, sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough and sneezing) was assessed on a 4-point scale (0 = none up to 3 = severe symptoms).\nMaximum score for TSS was 24 for each time point of registration.

Only the surgeon cannot be blinded to one of two groups. Patients, ward staff and radiologists will be blinded for study medication. Stratification will be done by diagnosis: benign versus malignant.\n\nThe fibrin sealant that used in this study is Quixil\u00ae Human Surgical Sealant Kit (hereinafter called Quixil\u00ae). It consists of a packet containing two components in separate vials of 5 ml. Vial I contains Biological Active Component (BAC): a concentrate of human clottable fibrinogen at a concentration of 40 - 60 mg/ml. A synthetic antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid (85 - 105 mg/ml) is added to the fibrinogen as a stabiliser. Vial II consists of a high concentration of human thrombin (800 - 1200 IU/ml) dissolved in a solution of 5.6 \u0096 6.2 mg/ml of calcium chloride. Both components undergo double viral-inactivation steps: treatment with solvent detergent followed by pasteurisation (at 60 degrees Celsius for ten hours) for the fibrinogen and nanofiltration for the thrombin. Quixil\u00ae is provided by the manufacturer in a 10 ml double-syringe spray-device. \n\nGroup 1:\nAfter liver resection and completion of hemostasis the envelope is opened showing treatment arm. Maximum 5 ml of fibrin sealant is sprayed or dripped on the resection surface of the liver. Maximum 5 ml of fibrin sealant is sprayed on the bare diaphragmatic resection surface. Preferably a drain will be placed adjacent to the cut liver surface.\n\nGroup 2:\nAfter liver resection and completion of hemostasis the envelope is opened showing control arm. Preferably a drain will be placed adjacent to the cut liver surface. \n\nDuration of treatment: single application during operation when patient is randomised in treatment arm. Total duration of follow-up will be 30 days.\n\nFor calculation of the required study-population size, resection surface-related complications such as bleeding, biloma and/or abscess formation are considered the most important target variables. Based on experience and publications of several centres, the overall proportion of these complications is estimated to be 15-20% when no fibrin sealant is applied to the resection surface (control group). A difference of about 50% between the control group and the fibrin sealant group is regarded as clinically significant. This would result in a proportion of 7.5-10% resection surface-related complications in the fibrin sealant group. Based on these assumptions, we calculated that a study size of 220 patients in each group will be needed to achieve 80% power at the 5% significance level. To have some safety margins it was decided to enrol 250 patients in each group.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study, however, will not only be the clinical presentation of a resection surface related complication, but also all CT scan detected complications. Although the exact incidence of CT scan detected complications is not known, this is expected to be higher than that of clinically detected complications. Therefore, an interim analysis will be performed after 180 patients (90 in each group). Main reason to do an interim analysis is to investigate weather the assumed complication rate is indeed 15 to 20%, or much higher. If the complication rate is higher, a smaller number of patients will be required to obtain the same level of statistical power as outlined above.\n\nAn interim analysis was performed in November 2009 after we had the completed CRF\u0092s of 180 patients enrolled in the FRESCO trial. An independent epidemiologist analysed the complication rate in the control group. This complication rate was higher than expected: 30,4%. Based on the complication percentage of 30.4% and on the assumption that a difference of 50% between the control group and the fibrin sealant group is clinically significant,  a study size of 131 patients in each group will be needed to achieve a 80% power at the 5% significance level.

Although muscles become weaker with ageing, strengthening exercises are effective in all age groups but require a sustained effort over long periods of time. Many people, irrespective of age, do not enjoy exercise and also the type of exercise necessary to increase muscle and bone strength is difficult for the more frail to perform.\n\nWhole body vibration (WBV) has been reported to increase muscle strength and power, bone mineral density, balance and speed of movement \u0096 all factors affecting the risk of both falling and sustaining a subsequent injury. The literature suggests that it is more effective for older and frail people than young highly trained ones. As relatively little effort is required for short periods the technique has real potential for improving the physical status of older people.\n\nWe have therefore incorporated WBV exercise into a strength and balance exercise class run for older individuals who have had multiple falls.

It is predicted to be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD exacerbations are an important feature of the disease, accounting for significant morbidity, mortality and health care costs. \n\nCOPD exacerbations are associated with bacterial and viral respiratory infections and airway inflammation. Current guidelines advocate the use of oral corticosteroids for patients with a COPD exacerbation who have increased dyspnoea and antibiotics in those with a history of more purulent sputum. A Cochrane review for the use of systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics in COPD exacerbations have shown that corticosteroids increase the rate of recovery following a severe exacerbation, reduce the length of hospital admission and reduce the proportion of patients that have treatment failure. However, it is likely these small corticosteroid-related benefits are confined to a sub-group of patients. Likewise antibiotic therapy in COPD exacerbations is beneficial, with a reduction in short-term mortality and treatment failure; however, the range of response was large and it is estimated that antibiotics are of clinical benefit in only 25 - 50% of COPD exacerbations. \n\nOur inability to identify accurately which patients with a COPD exacerbation should receive antibiotics and or corticosteroids inevitably leading to inappropriate and excessive use of treatment, is the basis of our hypothesis and the use of a single or composite to deliver targeted antibiotic and or corticosteroid therapy at the time of a COPD exacerbation.\n\nAs of 20/10/2009 this record was updated after a change to the protocol following MHRA approval.

Gram positive pathogens are immunologically recognised by the binding of their cell wall motifs to toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell surface. One such motif is LTA-T, which mediates its effects through TLRs.  \n\nWe hypothesised that LTA-T may be capable of inducing a therapeutically effective pleurodesis for the control of malignant pleural effusion. We have performed a dose escalation study to assess the toxicity/tolerability of LTA-T administered into the pleural space, and to produce preliminary data assessing potential pleurodesis efficacy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to confirm the favourable safety profile of LTA-T when administered intrapleurally and to define a maximum tolerated dose.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Adverse events (phase I toxicity trial), measured over the entire course of the study (i.e 12 weeks).", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

Height and weight will also be taken and a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed. The GP will be informed with the subjects\u0092 agreement.\nVisit 2, 3 and 4 - Subjects will be asked to have a light breakfast (excluding tea, coffee, alcohol) and arrive by 8.30am. They will lie down and an intravenous cannula will be inserted into the forearm through which we will take blood. They will also be connected to a heart monitor. After an hour, baseline measurements will be taken. This involves applying a probe to the surface of the neck and the wrist. Via a computer and software programme, we can then assess central aortic pressure too. Haemodynamic parameters to be measured include: augmentation index, aortic and radial pulse wave velocity and analysis. These will be measured using the SphygmoCor system 2-Atcor Medical, Sydney, Australia. This will allow assessment of central aortic blood pressure using a validated transfer function. Electrodes placed on the chest will record heart rate. This will allow us to determine heart rate variability during specific times during the study with the SphymoCor HRV system. Similarly, cardiac output, stroke volume and cardiac index will be determined. Peripheral blood pressure will also be measured using a sphygmomanometer. Following this, we will take about 10-15ml of blood (approximately a tablespoonful) and send it for the measurement of sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, renin and aldosterone and catecholamines.\nThen, subjects will be dosed with one of 3 pills orally: either atenolol 50mg, ivabradine 20mg or placebo (a dummy pill), but neither the volunteer nor the person doing the measurements will know which. Blood pressure readings will be repeated hourly and the blood tests at 4 hours. The final measurements will be made 4 hours post dosing, after which participants will be given food and drink and if the blood pressure and heart rate is acceptable, let home. Note that subjects are not permitted to eat or drink during the period of study. There will be a minimum 'washout' period of 3 days post which volunteers will attend for 2 more visits like the one described above but with different drugs (ie they will get all three types of pill during the course of the study).\n\nADVERSE EVENTS\nParticipants will be encouraged to report any adverse events and to contact members of the research team if they experience any problems. All serious adverse events will be reported to the Research and Development Department at Addenbrooke\u0092s Hospital and other authorities as appropriate.\n\nTERMINATION OF STUDY\nThe study will be ended when the last subject completes the study.

The study aims to establish the feasibility of using the therapeutic integration of MI and CBT for this patient group. Participants with the dual diagnosis of bipolar disorder and substance use will be recruited for this research and form two groups, one group receiving standard psychiatric care and the other psychiatric care and psychological therapy.\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating mental illness characterised by a recurring relapsing course, high risk of self harm and suicide (1-3), and considerable subclinical psychopathology outside full episodes (4, 5). The World Health Organization has identified bipolar disorder as the 6th leading cause of disability adjusted life years in the world among people aged 15-44 years (6), and estimated total costs to the UK per annum\namount to approximately \u00a32 billion (7). Lithium is an effective drug in prophylaxis, but fails to help about 20-40% of bipolar patients (8-11). The disorder is characterised by high rates of substance misuse, with studies in psychiatric and community settings reporting rates of 48-70% (12, 13). Such substance misuse can have profound effects on mood and behaviour which worsen the course, outcome and morbidity of bipolar disorder (14). For example, drugs and alcohol may disrupt sleep and circadian rhythms (15, 16), which can worsen prodromal symptoms and hence increase risk of relapse (17, 18). Furthermore, impulsiveness, which has been shown to be particularly elevated in bipolar patients with co morbid substance abuse (19), has been proposed as a possible factor in the significantly poorer treatment outcome and increased risks of suicide and violence observed in individuals with co morbid substance misuse compared to those bipolar disorder alone (14, 20, 21). Despite the high prevalence of substance use in bipolar disorder and its associated risks for illness complications, it has received very little attention within this diagnostic group.\n\nDesign:\nAs an exploratory study for a future definitive trial, the key questions of this study concern the feasibility and potential benefits of the new intervention in addition to standard care. Bipolar patients with co morbid substance misuse will receive individual psychological therapy plus standard psychiatric care or standard psychiatric care alone. A placebo control group is neither practical nor appropriate for a study of this scale.\nThe key issues to be addressed are; whether this intervention can be delivered and assessed appropriately with this group of patients; how outcome might optimally be measured and indicators of the potential benefits and costs of the proposed therapy.\n\nMethod:\nThe recruitment phase will benefit from the patient identification and recruitment systems established by the MIDAS trial (www.midastrial.ac.uk), in conjunction with the Mental Health Research Network. Recruitment will take place during the first nine months of the study. 20 participants, 10 randomised to each arm of the study will be recruited from three mental health trusts in the Manchester area:\n1. Pennine Care NHS Trust\n2. Bolton, Salford and Trafford Mental Health Partnership Trust\n3. Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust\n\nIdentifying potential participants:\nAll sites within the two trusts will be approached about the trial at the same stage. The research team aim to establish good liaisons with participating sites and services and ensure clinicians are well informed about the study and how to refer potential participants.\n\nEligible Participants:\nWhere permission is given eligible participants will be approached and introduced to the study by either the research assistant or care coordinator, depending on the preference of the care coordinator. Each potential participant in the community will be contacted by letter or telephone informing them in brief about the research and to arrange a time for the research assistant to visit them and introduce the study. All written correspondence, including consent forms and information sheets, will be written on headed paper and have contact information for the relevant research assistant. After the initial meeting potential participants will be given at least 24 hours to consider participation and will then be contacted by the research assistant (in a way agreed by the participant) to establish if they wish to take part in the study. The research assistant will visit each Potential participant interested in the study so that written consent can be obtained. Once participants have consented in writing an assessment for inclusion in the trial will be carried out using the SCID (a structured clinical interview) to confirm diagnosis. All potential participants will be assessed according to DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder; in addition patients will be interviewed concerning drug and alcohol use on the basis of the relevant SCID screening sections and regarding use in the preceding three months. Participants will be informed about their eligibility for the study and will be randomly allocated to the control group (treatment as usual) or the experimental group which involves treatment as usual plus the additional psychological therapy which is an integration of Motivational Interviews (MI) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). Therapy sessions will be offered in participants preferred location (NHS setting or home) to facilitate attendance. Participants in the experimental group will receive up to 26 therapy sessions over 12 months which will comprise of a one hour session every two weeks. Given the nature of the participants, the trial will be as flexible as time scales permit in offering additional appointments following periods of non-attendance. The follow-up period will be 10 months from initial randomisation into groups (patients will begin treatment within 2 weeks of randomisation). In addition to the therapy sessions participants will have regular assessments to evaluate bipolar relapse and substance use every three months as well as detailed assessment of social rhythms and activity, using the Social rhythm metric which records daily activity patterns over week long periods (22). Participants will also be asked to wear actiwatches for the initial week of the study and the final week of the study. Actiwatches are a non-invasive objective measure of activity using actigraphy (23, 24). Participants will be asked to complete the Beck depression inventory (BDI) and internal states scale (ISS) which will measure changes in mood. Reduction in impulsivity will be measured with the Barratt impulsiveness scale, a validated self report measure which has identified elevated impulsiveness in bipolar disorder and substance use (19). The additional psychological intervention (MI and CBT) is used to facilitate engagement and explore the role of substance misuse in worsening symptoms of bipolar disorder. Information collected will be used to create an individualised formulation identifying links between substance misuse and destabilisation. This will form the basis of a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy intervention focused on changing drug use behaviour and developing a comprehensive relapse prevention plan.\n\nTreatment Integrity:\nIndependent evaluation of therapy will be conducted by an independent rater who will listen to 10% of therapy tapes to assess for fidelity and competence. The California Psychotherapy Alliance Scale will be used as a measure of alliance and the Motivational Interviewing Treatment. Integrity code will be used to assess motivational interviewing skills. Treatment dose (frequency and duration) will be closely monitored.\n\nTimetable:\n0-4 months: recruit participants, assessment of participants\n4-11 months: treatment phase - additional psychological intervention (26 fortnightly sessions) and monthly assessments\n12-15 months: collate data, develop and maintain database\n15-17 months: follow up assessments, data entry for follow-up\n17-24 months: analysis of data, write scientific report", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2011 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898672 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "454d1286-15ea-43d6-872e-fec5781a66e5", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2011-09-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21898672"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder17014-0", "Funder17014-1"], "contactId": "Contact54975_17014", "sponsorId": "Sponsor53540"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact54975_17014", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Christine", "surname": "Barrowclough", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Academic Division of Clinical Psychology\n2nd Floor, ERC\nWythenshawe Hospital", "city": "Manchester", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "M23 9LT", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 0161291 5883"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "christine.barrowclough@man.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor53540", "organisation": "Record Provided by the NHSTCT Register - 2007 Update - Department of Health", "website": "http://www.dh.gov.uk/Home/fs/en", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "The Department of Health, Richmond House, 79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)20 7307 2622"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "dhmail@doh.gsi.org.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder17014-0", "name": "Bolton, Salford and Trafford Mental Health NHS Trust (UK)", "fundRef": null}, {"@id": "Funder17014-1", "name": "NHS R&D Support Funding", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "25", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2007-01-25T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "21047731"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial of antioxidant therapy in painful chronic pancreatitis", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "Anticipate Trial", "studyHypothesis": "This study is designed to test the principal hypothesis that anti-oxidant therapy with ANTOX version 1.2 reduces pain in patients with painful chronic pancreatitis.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Each patient enrolled in the study will contribute pain scores at baseline and six months from which a change in pain score will be calculated.

To gain percutaneous access to the kidney and perform subsequent renoscopy in order to remove renal stones for example, the urologist and uroradiologist must have excellent 3D spatial awareness.  Currently patients have 2D images taken pre-operatively.  Interventionalists use this data to mentally reconstruct a 3D image of the internal calyceal anatomy.  Understanding the anatomy is key to a successful intervention.  What would be of value is a reliable and valid imaging tool that is able to reconstruct in 3D the calyceal anatomy pre-operatively, and aid endourolgical intervention.  Normally patients with complex renal stones requiring surgery  have IVU's and CT's taken preoperatively at SGH.  We aim to obtain out-patient multi-slice CT scans on patients who fit our inclusion criteria, and who will be undergoing percutaneous intervention in the future.  The CT scans will be done as an outpatient investigation at the CT scan department of Princess Grace Hospital (the cost of which will be met by PGH administration).  3D CT will allow reconstruction of the fine ramifications of intracalyceal anatomy.  It is our hypothesis that with this data, 3D volume reconstruction will help in pre-operative planning, it will allow us to determine best route of access as well as allowing virtual endoscopy to be done prior to the procedure.

All updates can be found in the relevant field under the above update date. Please also note that the anticipated start and end dates of this trial have also changed. The previous anticipated trial dates are as follows:\nAnticipated start date: 01/09/2004\nAnticipated end date: 30/09/2006\nFinally, please note that the contact details below have changed since the initial assignation of an ISRCTN. The previous contact for this trial was Dr Lynne Chapman at the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust.\n\nCurrent hypothesis as of 15/09/2008:\nFibroids are common benign tumours of the smooth muscle of the uterus. Historically, an open myomectomy or a hysterectomy has been the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic fibroids. Intra-operative haemorrhage is the most feared complication of myomectomy, necessitating blood transfusion or worse, hysterectomy. Several interventions to reduce intra-operative blood loss at myomectomy have been described, including gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues and intra-operative application of triple tourniquets to occlude the uterine blood supply. \n\nGnRH analogues have been used for a long time to shrink fibroids and reduce blood loss. However, these agents are expensive, they need to be taken for several months prior to surgery in order to exert a noticeable effect, they cause unwanted oestrogen deficient symptoms, and because of their tissue effects, they tend to prolong the surgery. \n\nThe use of tourniquets to reduce intra-operative blood loss at open myomectomy is well established. A recent randomised controlled trial from our unit confirmed that triple tourniquets applied to the uterine and ovarian vessels significantly reduced operative blood loss, the need for blood transfusion and peri-operative morbidity at open myomectomy compared with controls. We propose to conduct a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues and triple tourniquets in reducing intra-operative bleeding compared at open and laparoscopic myomectomy.\n\nInitial hypothesis:\nDoes the application of surgical tourniquets around the major blood supply to the uterus reduce bleeding, thereby need the blood transfusion compared with traditional GnRH analogues?", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Current primary outcome measures as of 15/09/2008:\nIntra-operative blood loss, assessed by the standard method of meticulous measurement of blood loss during surgery, measured at conclusion of surgery.\n\nInitial primary outcome measures:\n1.

We hope to determine whether controlling blood pressure by specifically targeting the neurohumoral activation is more effective in regressing LVH than simple blood pressure control alone.
