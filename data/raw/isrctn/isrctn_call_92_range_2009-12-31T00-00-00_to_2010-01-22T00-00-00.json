Based on the results patients will be assigned to one of three risk groups (low/intermediate/high).\n\nThe tailored interventions are based on the risk factor assignment as follows:\n1. Low level risk: patients receive advice on staying active by the general practitioner and will be handed an educational booklet. This booklet aims at reducing erroneous back related beliefs and fosters active health related behaviours. It argues against a biomechanical model by emphasising psychological and social aspects of back problems. Patients receive information regarding local health activities promoting physical exercise, sports, relaxation.\n2. Physical risk group: in addition to the physicians' advices and the back book patients in will be offered participation in a guideline based intervention group that consists of two meetings of 120 minutes duration each. The main focus of these manualised meetings will be: education on \"back myths\" and risk factors, relaxation techniques, and motivation to stay active. Training selected physical exercises is a key element of these meetings. The groups will be conducted by experienced physiotherapists, and exercise therapists. The group size is limited to ten patients.\n3. Psychological risk group: patients will receive physicians' advice and the back book. In addition, they will be invited to participate in a psychosocial risk factor group that comprises two additional meetings of 120 minutes duration each. These meetings will be conducted by psychologists with a specialisation in pain treatment. Patients receive a manualised cognitive-behavioural intervention that focusses on pain and strain prone situations as well as on catastrophising, depressive, and fear-avoidant cognitions. The group size is limited to five patients.\n4. Combined physical and psychological risk group: patients will receive physicians' advice, the back book and an invitation to particiapte in both intervention groups as described above.\n\nAn attendance list will be taken for every course to monitor compliance. Patients receive an illustrated handbook designed specifically for the purpose of this trial with information on all covered topics. All therapeutic sessions will be structured based on a written manual. All participating therapists will have attended a training session of four hours.  \n\nTelephone, email counselling: \nIt is the aim of this counseling offer to answer back pain related questions that usually cannot be handled during a normal consultation. Local study coordinators (usually physiotherapists) will take on enquiries and pass them on  to the collaborating MDs, psychologists, and sport scientists, as best suited.

ERCP and preoperative biliary drainage will be performed by an experienced endoscopist, preferably by endoscopically insertion of a (plastic) stent\n2. One stent is generally sufficient because only distal obstruction is included\n3. If ERCP is not successful, patient can be referred to a centre for a second attempt for endoscopic drainage or a percutaneous drainage will be performed according to local experience\n4. Biliary drainage is considered adequate if a decrease of greater than 50% of serum bilirubin level is found after two weeks of drainage; otherwise the stent should be changed\n5. Exactly four weeks of preoperative biliary drainage patients will undergo surgery. In case of complications after ERCP or during the biliary drainage period (cholangitis, stent occlusion) a stent exchange will be performed.\n6. Other complications, such as bleeding or severe pancreatitis, should be treated according to the general locally accepted treatment protocol and/or consensus about management and could consequently lead to a delay of surgery\n7. Preoperative nutritional support (e.g. consultation with a dietician, nutri-drink) is recommended in patients with a weight loss of more than 15% during the last three months\n\nSurgical treatment: \nSurgery will be performed within one week after randomisation. Guidelines for exploration and treatment are described below: \n\n1. Surgery should be planned keeping in mind that the maximum estimated bilirubin level (greater than 40 \u00b5mol/l and less than 250 \u00b5mol/l at randomization) must not exceed 300 \u00b5mol/l, 24 hours before surgery (e.g. high bilirubin at randomization requires earlier surgery)\n2. Vitamin K (10 mg, oral, one day preoperatively) is given on indication and cefuroxim (1500 mg, intravenous single shot, \u00bd hour preoperatively) and sandostatin (or other analogues) (three times 100 \u00b5g, subcutaneous, 12 hours before surgery and continued for seven days after surgery) as prophylaxis\n3. During exploration the standard procedure will be the standard pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy as previously described (removal lymph nodes right side of portal vein). If indicated (suspicious ingrowth proximal duodenum/pylorus), a whipple procedure can be performed. In case of minimal vascular ingrowth a wedge resection of the portal/mesenteric vein can be performed\n4. Reconstruction is performed by pancreaticojejunostomy, a hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy\n5.

Normal management (control): \nThis group provides a realistic comparator, particularly for the economic component of the trial (so that the marginal costs of the intervention groups are realistically assessed). All trial participants will continue to be free to see their GP who will perform investigations, provide treatment - including drug treatments  - or refer as they would normally (and this will be documented). \n\n2. Longer course of lessons in the AT and book:\nThe practical content of each lesson will vary according to the needs and limitations of each participant. What has been taught, the practical procedures used and the participant's progress and difficulties will be recorded on standard sheets. After the first lesson and in the sixth week the Alexander teacher will record how useful they consider AT has been for each subject. Each participant will be encouraged to keep a record of the time outside lessons specifically devoted to AT. Each session will last 30 - 40 min. A standard text describing AT will also be given to each participant at the beginning of the course. The teachers will be included in the trial only if they have undergone a 3 year training at a STAT approved course; are members of STAT; and have at least 3 years post qualification experience. The aim in the longer course of lessons is to provide a much more comprehensive course in line with STAT\u0092s recommendations for a new pupil. Up to 24 lessons will be provided at the teacher\u0092s normal place of work: the initial course over 5 months (6 weeks at 2/week, 6 weeks at 1/week, 8 weeks at 1/2weeks) will be followed by two lessons for revision at 7 and 9 months.\n\n3. Introductory course of AT lessons and book:\nThis group represents a short intervention that has a good chance of being considered by NHS purchasers, and whose costs are in line with the likely costs of interventions from other major trials (e.g. UK BEAM). The aim is to provide an introductory set of lessons (six lessons), and not a comprehensive programme, with material to help understand AT. The first four lessons will be at twice weekly intervals and subsequent lessons weekly. The participant would also be free then to assess their own progress, and choose whether to fund further lessons themselves - as happens in normal practice. (The concern here is that the less affluent participants would be prevented from taking further lessons: what further lessons participants had, and the equity of this approach would therefore be key outcomes when assessing the effectiveness for this group.) \n\n4. Therapeutic massage:\nTherapeutic massage is widely used, is credible to patients and therapists. It will provide an attention and touch comparison for non-specific aspects of AT teaching, and is also important to assess since it may provide benefit in its own right. Patients will receive six sessions in accordance with current normal clinical practice (thus being equivalent to the introductory AT group). As with the introductory course of AT, patients will be free to have further sessions of massage at their own discretion, which mimics what would happen in normal practice. Any further sessions will be documented.\n\nGP Exercise Prescription factor:\nHalf the patients in each of the AT factor groups will be randomised to an appointment with a GP and follow-up nurse consultations. The GP appointment will be scheduled 6 weeks into the trial to maximise the likely benefit for those groups where exercise and AT are combined. The exercise 'prescription' will use the same format as the feasibility study (see above): the GP will specify the time and frequency of exercise, the date to start on the sheet, and give the sheet to the participant to display in a prominent place around the house. The GP will briefly discuss a list structured points based on previous behavioural literature: the importance of exercise; finding a regular exercise to incorporate into daily life  (either walking or equivalent); aiming for a target of 30 min walking 5 times per week according to current national guidelines; and anticipating relapse. Three follow-up appointments with a practice nurse (i.e. four in total) will deal with the same issues as the GP, provide reinforcement and encourage maintenance.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2008 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18713809 results\n2008 Other publications in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074232 economic evaluation\n2010 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032168 results on patient views", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": [{"@id": "cb3025b6-aecf-4ada-95de-d204a6e3abc6", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2008-08-19T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18713809"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "f4042e7b-2120-4655-88de-0d7a89a21512", "@outputType": "otherpublications", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2008-12-11T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19074232"}, "description": "economic evaluation", "productionNotes": null}, {"@id": "72fa657b-daea-421f-8eab-a0ae92d9210a", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032168"}, "description": "results on patient views", "productionNotes": null}]}, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder1315-0", "contactId": "Contact5163_1315", "sponsorId": "Sponsor50468"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact5163_1315", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Paul S", "surname": "Little", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Primary Medical Care Group\nCommunity Clinical Sciences Division\nUniversity of Southampton\nAldermoor Health Centre\nAldermoor Close", "city": "Southampton", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SO16 5ST", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)23 8024 1062"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "psl3@soton.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor50468", "organisation": "University of Southampton (UK)", "website": "http://www.soton.ac.uk/", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "University Road", "city": "Southampton", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SO17 1BJ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 (0)23 8059 5000"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Public", "gridId": "grid.5491.9", "rorId": "https://ror.org/01ryk1543"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder1315-0", "name": "Medical Research Council (MRC) (UK)", "fundRef": "http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265"}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2010-01-07T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "26", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "54949546"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "The effect of pre-operative warming on wound infection rates after clean surgery", "scientificTitle": "Laser doppler flowmetry of skin circulation to measure the effects of using two warming therapies: a randomised clinical trial of surgical patients", "acronym": null, "studyHypothesis": "To assess whether warming patients before short duration, clean surgery will reduce infection rates.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Wound infection; masked outcome assessments made at 2 and 6 weeks", "secondaryOutcome": "Added as of 07/01/2010:\n1.
