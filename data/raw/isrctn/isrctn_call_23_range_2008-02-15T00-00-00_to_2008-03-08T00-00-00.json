The previous end date of this trial was 31/07/2007. On 18/12/2007 the anticipated end date was extended again to 01/04/2008 due to a continued low recruitment rate. On the 05/03/2008 the anticipated end date was again amended to show the end date as the 29/02/2008 - this is the date this trial was closed to enrolment. \n\nSample size/power calculation:\nBased on a preliminary examination, we determined that the \u0093minimal\u0094 important difference for this intervention to be considered useful was a 20% absolute improvement.\n\nBased on a preliminary test of 300 doctors, we determined that the \u0093mean\u0094 improvement due to the intervention, was a 28% absolute improvement. Therefore we calculated our sample size to detect a 0.7 standardised difference in the primary outcome, set the \u03b1 error rate at 0.05 (two-sided), and the \u03b2 error at 0.10 (power 90%) \u0096 this yielded a sample size of 45 practitioners per study arm.

ECCE has four components: \n1. The Clinical Evidence chapter (e.g. headache, chronic tension-type), a clinical vignette derived from the Clinical Evidence chapter gives a plausible medical scenario (e.g. Margaret says to her family doctor: \u0093This time I didn\u0092t come for me, but to talk about Rachel, my 25-year-old daughter\u0085)\n2. The lead-in for the clinical vignette and related questions that gives the doctors instructions on what to do (e.g. \"more than one answer may be correct\u0094)\n3. The questions addressing the recall of Clinical Evidence facts or the application of Clinical Evidence facts to the medical scenario, based on which the doctor is to select the correct answer\n4. And finally the potential answers (e.g. a list of potential efficacy descriptors for a therapeutic regimen relevant to the theme) \n\nGroup one access to ECCE for Clinical Evidence chapters and vignettes lot A and provides control data for Clinical Evidence chapters and vignettes lot B.\nGroup two access to ECCE for lot B and provides control data for lot A. \n\nTo determine the possible Hawthorne effect of this trial, we added to the two-block design arms a third control arm (classical design), in which a minimal intervention was defined.

The Department of Health has funded this work, to establish proof of principle of the effect of individual and team drill training on the ability of labour ward staff to manage acute obstetric emergencies. The study evaluates training involving simulation centre and local in-house labour ward drills, so that future policies and studies can be based on the most promising methods.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of individual and team drill for the management of acute obstetric emergencies. The specific research questions are:\n\n1. Primary questions\na. Does the use of a high fidelity setting improve clinical skills in obstetric emergencies?\nb. Does including team training in emergency drills improve clinical skills in dealing with obstetrics emergencies?\n\n2. Secondary questions\na. Does team training in obstetric emergency drills improve team working?\nb. Does the use of a high fidelity setting improve team working in obstetric emergencies?\nc.

The intervention program was based on Social Cognitive Theory and consisted of ten 90-minute activity-based sessions during each of the two years. It focused on the development of behavioural skills to choose Ca-rich foods and to engage in weight-bearing physical activity. Behavioural goals for the intervention were to\nincrease daily dietary Ca intake to 1300 mg/day (increase of 4 daily servings of Ca rich foods; about 800 Ca mg/day) and to increase weight-bearing physical activity to 120 minutes per week. A continuously available, interactive web-based program, and a one-week summer camp between 5th and 6th grade years, were implemented as components of the intervention program.

They will be randomised to treatment as usual or to the experimental group and treated for up to three months. Assessment of health service costs, suicide intent and acts, mood disturbance and social functioning will be made before randomisation and after six months by an independent research psychologist. \n\nIf the treatment is found to be successful an application will be made to the MRC for a larger study in a population with less restrictive entrance criteria.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The main outcome measures will be the time of the next parasuicide act (using Linehan's definition of this, which is more minor than an actual suicide attempt).
