Biofilm is a pathogenetic factor in the formation of salivary stones.\n2. In selective collected saliva from healthy individuals there is no growth of bacteria.\n3. In selective collected saliva from the salivary stone patients bacteria can grow or bacterial products can be found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that correspond to bacteria cultured from saliva stone.\n4. The chemical composition of the saliva (organic and inorganic) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is different in patient with salivary gland stones compared to a control group of healthy individuals.\n5. In Denmark there is an association of the incidence of sialolithiasis and the calcium level in drinking water.\n6. Sialendoscopy is an effective treatment of salivary gland stones.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims\nThe formation of salivary gland stone (sialolithiasis) is the most common disease of the salivary glands. The incidence has not been fully evaluated, neither in Denmark nor internationally. The composition of salivary gland stone are well described, but their cause remains unknown. Sialolithiasis is often associated with sialadenitis (painful inflammation of the salivary glands). It has not, however, been studied if bacterial infection plays a significant role for development of these conditions. Examination of saliva and salivary gland stones can help clarify the role of certain bacteria for development and pathology of sialolithiasis.\nWith the recent introduction of endoscopic treatment of the salivary gland (sialoendoscopy), it is now possible to remove stones from the duct of the gland. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the composition of the salivary duct stones. \nThe aim of the project is to study the incidence of sialolithiasis, identify risk factors, evaluate the sialoendoscopic treatment and study whether biofilm (an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other on a surface) and bacteria contributes to stone formation. Other aspect of this study is to demonstrate that preserving the salivary gland and the salivary gland function by sialondoscopy is beneficial for the patients.\nThe project may enhance knowledge on the incidence, treatment and causes of sialolithiasis. Such knowledge may be of importance for future treatment and prevention of sialolithiasis.\n\nWho can participate?\nThe study aims to recruit about 100 patients > 18 years (men and women) scheduled for sialendoscopy or surgical removal of the submandibular gland due to salivary gland stones in Denmark. The study recruits about 100 healthy volunteers >18 years as a control group.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nThe project is composed of an epidemiologic and a clinical part. \nThe epidemiologic part is based on data from the Danish Health Service databases, in which we will calculate the incidence of sialolithiasis and the distribution on sex, age and geography. We will look for possible hereditary factors as well as for an association between sialolithiasis and the presence of inorganic compounds in drinking water. \nFor the clinical part: Over a period of two years patients who are scheduled for surgical treatment of salivary gland stones will be invited to participate in the study. A control group of healthy individuals is also enrolled. The study will evaluate sialendoscopy as a method, and the importance of preserving the salivary gland and the salivary gland function. Also patient\u0092s salivary gland functions before and after sialendoscopy will be assessed. In addition, we will examine the oral health including risk of carries and test for changes in saliva content of enzymes. Patients expressed experience, of the effect of the treatment and their quality of life will be obtained. A blood sample will be obtained to see if patients with sialolithiasis have a higher level of certain hormone. Finally, we will examine the removed salivary stone, saliva and salivary gland tissue. \nThe healthy control group will undergo only sialometry and we will examine the bacteria and the chemical composition of the \u0093healthy\u0094 saliva (organic and inorganic).\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere will be no direct benefit from participating but the patient will gain an objective measurement for the effect of the surgical treatment. The study will benefit future patients with salivary gland stones because of enhanced knowledge on the disease.\nPossible risks in the intervention group: Sialometry is not associated with any risks or discomfort . The blood sample is associated with short-term pain and can leave a bruise. The salivary gland scintigraphy will expose the patients to a low radiation dose (6 mSv) \nThe control group will undergo only sialometry .\n \nWhere is the study run from?\nThe study has been set up by Hiller\u00f8d Hospital and Rigshospitalet, Denmark in collaboration with the Dentist school, Panum institute Denmark.\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nThe recruitment started in May 2012. The recruitment period will last approximately 2 years; however the study will extend beyond this as we intend to look at the participant\u0092s health over approximately 10 years to evaluate the long term outcome of the surgical treatment\n\nWho is funding the study?\nFunding has been provide by Hiller\u00f8d Hospital Research foundation, ENT department Hiller\u00f8d Hospital, Olga Bryde Nielsen foundation\n\nWho is the main contact?\nDr. Stine Attrup Schr\u00f8der\nssc@hih.regionh.dk", "primaryOutcome": "1.

However, it is not known what changes in dopaminergic and serotonergic metabolism will be induced by quetiapine at central sites and in the periphery, whether these changes will be interrelated and whether these changes will be related to clinical response.\n\nTherefore, the effect of quetiapine on serotonine and dopamine in man will be measured in a study in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5-HIAA and HVA (metabolites of serotonine and dopamine) and of some neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y [NPY] and corticotropin releasing factor [CRF]) will be determined before (baseline) and after a 4 week administration (post-treatment) of quetiapine (600 mg/daily) in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Moreover, quetiapine will be measured in CSF and plasma to study the transport into the brain. Furthermore, we will assess whether the presumed change of CSF 5-HIAA, HVA and the improvement of clinical symptoms will be related to the receptor occupancy of quetiapine and to its pharmacokinetics in plasma and CSF.\n\nThis study design allows us to correlate pre- to post-treatment changes in biochemical variables as well as with psychopathological response.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Level of HVA at baseline and after quetiapine treatment (4 weeks) in CSF", "secondaryOutcome": "1. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics:\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs are generally biotransformed to metabolites that have a different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile from that of the parent compound. Consequently, the hypothesis that metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties of a drug and its metabolites play an important role in their overall pharmacological activity is plausible and needs to be explored for quetiapine. Preliminary exploratory information will be obtained on:\n1.1. The relative concentrations of quetiapine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) versus plasma, and on the plasma/CSF ratio-clinical effectiveness relationship in patients with schizophrenia, taking into account the phenotype/genotype of MDR1-polymorphism. To date no published data are available on this issue.\n1.2. The role of the MDR1-polymorphism on the concentrations of quetiapine and 5-HIAA and HVA in CSF, and on the possible existence of a transport of quetiapine through the blood brain barrier\n\nThe hypothesis is that the relative concentrations of quetiapine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are approximately half of those in plasma, measured after 4-week quetiapine treatment. Moreover, quetiapine administration should result in a highly significantly correlation between quetiapine in plasma and quetiapine in CSF concentrations. \n\n2. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides:\nDysregulation of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems as well as altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are likely, but not necessary involved in pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, accumulated evidence indicates that NPY, as well as CRF, also play a role. Preliminary exploratory information will be obtained on:\n2.1. The relative concentrations of neuropeptides e.g. NPY and CRF measured at pre-treatment and after quetiapine medication period and the relationship with clinical improvement. To date no published data are available on this issue.\n\nThe determinations of NPY and CRF in CSF, measured at baseline and after treatment will significant predict the degree of symptom improvement following 4 weeks quetiapine treatment (i.e. decrease in PANSS total score) and correlate with the availability of quetiapine in the central nervous system as shown by its CSF concentrations.\n\n3. Neuroimaging:\nThe primary motive for seeking information on the occupancy of central nervous system (CNS) receptors by drugs is that the kinetics of a drug in brain may differ from its kinetics in plasma. The drug receptor complex may dissociate more slowly than the rate by which the concentrations of free drug is reduced in blood. It is also possible that the drug does not reach its target because of diffusion barriers or rapid peripheral metabolism. Kinetics of the drug at its target site can only be assessed by non-invasive imaging techniques like PET. Preliminary information will be obtained on:\n3.1. The relationship between D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy and CSF kinetics of quetiapine, biochemical parameters (5-HIAA and HVA) and clinical improvement. To date no published data are available on this issue.\n\nThe determinations of D2 and 5-HT2A occupancy, measured at baseline and after treatment will significantly predict the degree of symptom improvement following 4 weeks quetiapine treatment (i.e. decrease in PANSS total score) and correlate with the availability of quetiapine in the central nervous system as shown by its CSF concentrations. Moreover, occupancy of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors correlate significantly with the changes in the CSF 5-HIAA and HVA concentrations.\n\n4. Clinical variables:\nFor the evaluation of the clinical response of the patients under the neuroleptic treatment with quetiapine in exploratory way PANSS and CGI-ratings will be applied. In addition, PANSS-ratings will be related to the expected change in the primary variable to assess a probable relationship between the changes in 5-HIAA induced by quetiapine and the clinical state at the end of the treatment.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Ethics Committee of the Johann-Wolfgang-University of Frankfurt a.

The provision to the patient and family of understandable, appropriate and correct information may be effective in positively influencing post-stroke home care. However, a number of recent reports have demonstrated that the implementation of this policy into routine practice may be difficult to achieve. Several small studies in the UK have highlighted the difficulties in successfully implementing strategies for information provision. No evidence of effectiveness in reducing anxiety or improving social functioning has been reported but there was a suggestion that the patients were more satisfied with their level of knowledge and appreciated booklets. It is likely that the method of delivering the information is as important as its content. Simply providing information, particularly when set in a complex area such as stroke, may be too simplistic as it is too passive an approach. \nA more active, educational approach may be successful. Thus a formal educational or teaching programme specifically designed for patients and carers may have some special relevance. Such an experimental educational programme was established and evaluated in the USA and reported positive effects including improving caregiver stroke knowledge and family coping strategies. To develop this work further we are going to evaluate by randomised trial the effectiveness of a short educational programme for patients and caregivers after stroke. \nResearch Questions \n1. That a structured package of information provision for patients recovering from stroke and their carers is associated with improved to usual (unstructured) information provision. \n2. That a structured package delivered by a facilitator is more effective than either simple provision of the structured information, or usual care. \nThe primary outcome of interest is patient and carer understanding of stroke, with a secondary outcome of reduction in handicap.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1.
