In Canada, LTOT is usually provided by a stationary oxygen concentrator and is recommended to be used for at least 15 - 18 hours a day. Several studies have demonstrated a deterioration in arterial blood gas pressures and oxygen saturation during sleep in patients with COPD. Sleep-related oxygen desaturation often occurs in patients not qualifying for LTOT. The suggestion has been made that the natural progression of COPD to its end stages of chronic pulmonary hypertension, severe hypoxemia, right heart failure, and death is dependent upon the severity of desaturation occurring during sleep. This is an attractive hypothesis and is supported by the fact that hypoxemic episodes during sleep are accompanied by substantial increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and often by important cardiac arrhythmias. Supplemental nocturnal oxygen alleviates both the acute increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and the cardiac arrhythmias.  \n\nIt has been suggested that, over the long run, nocturnal oxygen therapy (N-O2) may halt the progression of long-standing cor pulmonale and prolong survival. Probably due to the fact that the recommendations of scientific societies regarding the indications for and use of N-O2 in COPD not qualifying for conventional LTOT are presently imprecise, a number of patients are currently treated with N-O2 although the beneficial effects of this therapy have not been confirmed.\n\nHypothesis:\nIn patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) not qualifying for Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT) but who present significant nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation, nocturnal oxygen therapy provided for a period of 3 years is effective in decreasing mortality or delaying the requirement for LTOT, and is cost-effective and favourably compares to other medical interventions", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The primary outcomes of this trial are mortality from all cause or requirement for LTOT (composite outcome).", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

Face-to-face\n2. Community based media\n3. Community groups\n\nControl group:\nReceives usual care.\n\nSome of the details of the intervention, such as the frequency or duration of contact or exposure to the channels will only be fully defined at the end of the formative research phase. Interventions at the health facility level may include in-service training of the physicians and nurses in the health centres to improve their communication and counselling skills. Training of health workers and community counselors in this course will, we believe, be an important component of the intervention. The intervention may also include changes in management procedures to make them more compatible with family needs and expectations. Access to off-hour advice, privacy of consultations, triage and waiting time and characteristics of the waiting room are some of the examples of areas that may be considered for improvement. \n\nInterventions at the community level will make maximal use of appropriate existing channels either to be the primary sources of dissemination of messages or to re-enforce them. In addition to face-to-face communications individually or in group, the team will also consider the use of local mass media (e.g. local radio, pamphlets, banners, and posters), work and social clubs. The intervention will probably include the provision of information and the development with families of problem-solving approaches/strategies to deal with significant constraints. Face-to-face counselling will be one of the key components. Additional components may be included to remove existing barriers or promote actions that will support an increase in prevalence of a desired behaviour (for example, making breastfeeding counsellors available in the community for greater ease of access to counselling and support when mothers face a feeding difficulty).\n\nEighteen months after the introduction of the intervention, when we expect that the intervention will have been fully functional in all intervention clusters for at least 12 months, the post-intervention survey will be conducted to measure the impact on infants up to 12 months old. The length of exposure to the intervention will depend on the age of the infant and the period he/she has been residing in the community. Control clusters will continue to be provided the usual type of health care.\n\nContact details for Principal Investigator:\nDr Ibargollen Negrin Longina\nMinisterio de Salud Publica\nMCH Division\nCalle 23 entre M y N.

Patients who suffer from this disorder have a 20% higher risk to develop obstructive disease of the blood vessels of the heart and heart attack.\n\nThe patients with CHL have abnormalities of blood lipids (fat) similar to those observed in patients who suffer from another condition known as the 'metabolic syndrome' who are also at higher risk of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. One of the features of this metabolic syndrome is a reduced response to the hormone insulin. This hormone helps the tissues of the body (in particular the muscles and the heart) to use sugar. Sugar is very important for the heart since it contributes to generate the energy which is used to sustain its function.\n\nIn patients with the metabolic syndrome insulin is less effective and the heart tissue has difficulties in using sugar and develops a condition known as 'insulin resistance'. Previous studies have shown that this condition of insulin resitance can contribute to the higher incidence of heart disease in patients with the metabolic syndrome.\n\nPioglitazone is a drug licenced in the UK which acts by sensitising the liver and peripheral tissues (including the heart) to the effect of insulin, which results in improved insulin-mediated sugar disposal. Previous studies have demonstrated that pioglitazone lowers sugar and insulin levels in the blood and improves lipid (fat) metabolism (utilisation) in patients with diabetes. We expect similar beneficial effects in patients with familial CHL treated with pioglitazone.\n\nWe therefore hypothesise that patients with CHL will have insulin resistance at the heart muscle level as well as an abnormal function of the vessels supplying blood to the heart and that treatment with pioglitazone will improve these\n\nTo prove our hypothesis we will use a special scan called Positron Emission Tomography (PET) which permits to measure the utilisation of sugar by the heart in a totally non-invasive fashion. PET is also capable of providing information on the function of the vessels supplying blood to the heart. Patients with familial CHL will be studied by means of PET before and after 4 months of treatment with pioglitazone.

After data from activity monitors are downloaded, participants in the experimental contingent group will be told how much time they earned in each of the following two weeks for TV/VCR viewing and video games played via TV (e.g. Nintendo etc.). Parents will be taught how to program the TV allowance, which is an electronic device that records and helps budget TV/VCR viewing and video game playing. We acknowledge that targeted children may watch TV with parents or friends outside the house, or play computer games on a PC computer, and this will be measured by the concomitant use of self-report measures of sedentary activity. It is important to note that these potential sources of contamination also existed in previous clinical research that reduced access to TV viewing in obese children, and marked increases in physical activity were still obtained. Parents will be asked to implement the contingencies for two weeks beyond 12-week post-treatment to encourage physical activity between weeks 10 and 12, and this fading of contingency management may provide an opportunity for parents to implement their own contingencies. \n\nControl: Non-Contingent group -\nParticipants in the non-contingent control group will also visit the laboratory bi-weekly to have their physical activity monitors downloaded. They will also be given a TV allowance for monitoring purposes (and to control for this device in the home), but parents will be explicitly told that children should have free access to targeted sedentary activities independent of physical activity. The control group is designed to control for contact with investigators, feedback on physical activity levels, passage of time, the effects of wearing the activity monitors, and the presence of the TV allowance in the home.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder13457-0", "contactId": "Contact51100_13457", "sponsorId": "Sponsor49503"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact51100_13457", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Gary Scott", "surname": "Goldfield", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario\nResearch Institute", "city": "Ottawa, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "K1H 8L1", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+1 613 737 7600 ext. 3288"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "ggoldfield@cheo.on.ca"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor49503", "organisation": "Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (Canada)", "website": "http://www.cheo.on.ca/english/hub.shtml", "sponsorType": "Not defined", "contactDetails": {"address": "401 Smyth Road", "city": "Ottawa, Ontario", "country": "Canada", "zip": "K1H 8L1", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.414148.c", "rorId": "https://ror.org/05nsbhw27"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder13457-0", "name": "Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (Canada) - http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca (ref: MCT-53574)", "fundRef": null}}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2007-11-29T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "23", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2005-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "95608630"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "Intensive insulin therapy does not alter the inflammatory response in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG): a randomized controlled trial", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "CH0401", "studyHypothesis": "Strict glucose control in critically ill patients alters the cytokine balance towards a more pro-inflammatory state.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Cytokine levels", "secondaryOutcome": "Complement concentration", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN95608630", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "CH0401"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2003-09-01T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2004-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Netherlands"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "4a303d87-bf2d-4c53-acc0-40eb50d4efe6", "name": "Geert Grooteplein 10", "address": null, "city": "Nijmegen", "state": null, "country": "Netherlands", "zip": "6500 HB"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.
