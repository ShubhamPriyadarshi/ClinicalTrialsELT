The aims of treatment for elderly diabetic patients are at glycemic control and risk factor modification to reduce the risk of complications from diabetes and a substantial number of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The evidence-based studies have demonstrated that rates of disease and death can be reduced more by targeting cardiovascular risk factors than by intensively managing hyperglycemia in diabetics. The elderly patients can benefit from long term intensive multi factorial diabetic control. \n\nAlthough more effective treatment regimens became widely available, several reports documented little improvement in glycemic control in adults in the US with diabetes. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately half of cohorts with diabetes met the American Diabetes Association glycemic goal. In other larger reported population, only 2-10% of diabetic patients achieved the combined ADA goals for glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure. Although glycemic control, treatment for diabetes and patient care were improved in recent years in china, the rates of treatment and control of DM were still low [13]. It was reported recently that only 35% of patients had fasting plasma glucose <126mg/dl and about 40.2% met the International Diabetes Federation (IDF, 2005) glycemic goal (HbA1c < 6.5%). An observational study showed, in Hong Kong Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, 36.7% reached the blood pressure goal (<130/80mmHg), 28.6% attained the LDL cholesterol goal (<2.6 mmol/l), and 43.7% achieved the A1C goal (<7.0%), while only 6.3% attained all three targets.  \nContributing to these poor outcomes is believed to be related to current medical system that is poorly designed to manage chronic diseases that require frequent, intensive follow up and detailed patient counseling and education. The barriers to providing optimal diabetes care in the system include insufficient time to monitor and treat the complex clinical issues during visits, general lack of behavioral change skills, and lack of guideline adherence. Additionally, geriatric patients have complex problems such as depression, poor physical performance, reduced cognitive function, difficult social situations, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and limited family and financial support. These age-associated states more likely reduce the frequency of visiting to hospital and the ability to carry out treatment.\n \nIn face of increasing number of diabetics, physicians or specialists are increasingly allotted less time with each patient in China. Their behaviors are passive and their services are intermittent for patients because they only provide medical regimens and advices on regular visits in hospital clinics. Thus, the present medical system associated with diabetes in the elderly make it difficult to achieve multiple goals in limited visits.\nThe gap between these practical benefits or recommended care targets and the realities of an individual situation and care delivery models makes diabetes care for the elderly with diabetes more challenging. Recently, many models or approaches have been tried to improve the diabetes care, such as the case management and the chronic case model. Some published studies appeared to demonstrate their effectiveness, but others did not. The exact reason for the discrepancies in care remains uncertain. In the last few years, community health care service with general practice has been developed in China. On the basis, combined with the conceptual framework of structured diabetes shared care, we developed a dynamic and sustained diabetes management approach for the elderly with T2DM, which made the integrated treatment for the elderly patients become a proactive and continuous diabetes care.

Twenty six patients randomized to intervention group were followed by each of the five multidisplinary diabetes care teams established in the four assigned communities \n2. Each team included one primary care physician, two trained nurses and one clinical staff\n3. The total 18 month follow-up to individuals was conducted\n4. At the study entry, intervention patients were invited and had an initial visit with specialists, and the electronic individual diabetes care record (or registry) was established and the individual therapeutic project directed by the specialists was worked out after assessment of the recorded DM data based on the baseline examination \n5. The care team followed up actively on diabetes care management protocols, which mainly included:\n5.1. Exercise prescription: The individual patient was asked to have walking for 30 to 40 minutes daily at least three days weekly, at 110 to 120 steps per minute with exercise heart rate less than 100 bumps per minute, adjusted for patient ability.\n5.2. Diabetes dietary advice: Ten reference diet options were supplied based on the daily overall calorie requirement which was determined according to age, height, desired weight and physical activity of individual patient. \n5.3. Drug therapy regimens: Oral hypoglycemic agents include metformin (for overweight   patients), glipizide and glyburide (for patients with normal weight). If goal for glycemia is not met, metformin should be combined with a sulphonylurea before starting insulin. For most patients with hypertension, antihypertensive drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB), bata blocker or/and calcium channel blockers were applied. Thiazides were given to hyprtensive patients over 70 years of age. ACEI or ARB was also adminstered to the patients with albuminuria as well as with blood pressure more than or equal to (>/=) 130/80 mmHg. Albuminuria, including micro- and macroalbuminuria, was defined as urinary albumin excretion rate(UAER)>/=30 mg/d. Lipid-lowering pharmacologic agents were administered to patients with diet resistant hyperlipidaemia.Subcutaneuos injection of human gene recombination insulin was performed if patients tended to fail oral hypoglycemic agents. The physicians were responsible for determining the initial insulin dosages and for making any dosage changes.\n5.4. Monitoring: Capillary blood glucose concentration, blood pressure and weigh were detected monthly by nurses. The physycian was requested to define, together with the patient, the best possible goals for glycemia, blood pressure and body mass index(BMI) with three predefined categories. At each monthly follow-up, the physican was asked to compare the achievements with the goal and consider changing either goal or treatment accordingly. In patients with weiht gain, the care provider was prompted to get agreement on a small, realistic weight reduction and follow up on this. However, a specific relative body weight was not strived for. The aim is normalisation of glycemia, blood pressure and BMI. For some patients, it will be impossible or even inappropriate to try to achieve the ideal goal, but prolonged symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia must not be accepted for any patient. \n5.5. Proactive management support: The team members provided patients with one-on-one education regarding diabetes self-management skills needed to carry out medical regimens, guide health behavior change, and provide emotional support, tailored to the needs of the individual patients. The physicians made timely treatment decision for adjustments of hypoglycemic or/and antihypertensive medications, and helped patients confer with specialists as needed in person or by telephone.\nGenerally, the care providers notified patients of schedualed visits via phone and contaced them in the community health care service centers where the patients lived in conjunction with their routine primary care visits on a monthly basis, unless more frequent assessment or recommendations were neede. Any patient who missed his or her appointment was reschedualed or visited at home. The computerized patient registry system allowed the care providers to have data of the results recording in flow sheet and up-to-date information regarding their patients. After the check-up, the physician discussed the results with the patient in detail, and decided how to act upon them accordingly. The patients were refered to the specialist in tertiary hospital by the two-way referral approach if they had poor control or needed some specific treatment or detection. There is no on-site diabetes education programs in these community health care service centers to reduce the probability of cross-contamination in both groups.\nThe control group was kept as a natural control; that is, they only visited tertiary hospitals and received diabetes treatment in a specialty clinic, including irregular or regular follow-up visits with specialists (e.g. endocrinologists or diabetologists). The decisions visiting to specialists were made by patients themselves.\n6. Teatment goals for intervention group:\n6.1 Fasting capillary whole blood glucose (mmol):\n6.1.1.

Such patient care pathways employ a multimodal approach to promote a rapid return to normal function. The Danish group around Kehlet, the originator of ERAS, claim that a hospital stay of 3 days or less for major colorectal surgery is now customary in their institutions whilst median stays using an ERAS approach of around 6 days have been produced elsewhere \n\nControversies exist regarding intraoperative fluid management for major colorectal surgery. In recent decades fluid restriction has been advocated, however such an approach uniformly applied risks bowel ischaemia and other complications. \n\nGoal Directed Fluid therapy (GDT) refers to fluid management targeted toward improving the cardiac output to set levels, hence improving end organ perfusion. Minimally invasive devices are now available to measure cardiac stroke volume. Intra-operative GDT has been shown to reduce median hospital length of stay after major colorectal surgery from 9 to 7 days. \n\nThis study aims to determine whether goal directed fluid therapy gives additional benefit to patients undergoing surgery within an ERAS programme, and aims to address the controversies regarding fluid management. \n\nAs of 2007, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust provides a service to risk stratify patients undergoing elective surgery by Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET), which can identify patients with a low cardiorespiratory reserve. These patients are at increased risk of complications after surgery. We have the capacity to perform CPET pre-operatively for all patients booked for elective major colonic or colorectal resection surgery.

There has been growing awareness that it may not be necessary to remove as much carious dental tissue as was previously thought. By simply changing the environment within which the caries is progressing, and making it unfavourable for the micro-organisms involved, the number and diversity of micro-organisms can be dramatically reduced. This means that the carious disease process may be slowed down, perhaps halted, and possibly even reversed. The Hall technique makes use of a simplified, potentially more acceptable method of placing Preformed Metal Crowns (PMCs). It is used to seal the carious lesion into the tooth, making the environment unfavourable by limiting the lesion\u0092s access to nutrients. This should slow, or even arrest the progress of the carious lesion through the tooth. In addition, by avoiding the use of Local Anaesthesia (LA) and caries removal, it is possible that the Hall technique might be more acceptable than standard restorative techniques to children, their parents and General Dental Practitioners (GDPs). The randomised controlled clinical trial reported in this thesis was designed to investigate these hypotheses. \n\nThe overall aim of the research project was to determine whether the Hall technique offered benefits over current practice to restore carious primary molar teeth in general dental practice in Tayside. Specifically, the potential benefits of interest were:\n1. Acceptability of the procedure\n2. Long-term pulpal health\n3. Longevity of the restoration, and \n4. Costs of the procedures together with their follow-up maintenance\n\nThis led to the following null hypotheses being tested through the clinical trial:\n1. After a minimum of 23 months, there is no difference in the incidence of signs and symptoms of pulpal disease between teeth restored with control restorations and those with PMCs fitted using the Hall technique\n2. After a minimum of 23 months, there is no difference in longevity of restorations between control restorations and PMCs fitted using the Hall technique\n3. Children, their carers and GDPs have no preference between the Hall technique and control restorations placed by their GDPs, and\n4. After a minimum of 23 months, there is no difference in the cost of provision and maintenance of the control restorations and Hall PMCs to the service provider\n\nInformation on the pilot trial at http://www.dundee.ac.uk/tuith/Articles/rt03.htm", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The following outcomes will be assessed at least 23 months after the placement of the crown:\n1.

No other drugs, herbs, or non-prescription products for obesity were allowed during the study.\n\nAn intensive dietary intervention including personalised diet instructions and prepared food was provided. Participants in both groups were supplied with supplemental foods which met the diet parameters to facilitate compliance and to avoid having diet restrictions produce a financial burden for participants. Breakfast and lunch were provided on a daily basis and dinners were prepared along dietary guidelines by participants. They were instructed to maintain a caloric intake of 1800 calories. Additionally, they also received a personalised exercise regimen which instructed them to exercise at least one half hour, four times a week.

"interventions": {"intervention": {"description": "Rosiglitazone has been noted to have effects on the vasculature. We hypothesise that it may improve endothelial function and reduce arterial stiffness. We believe that the effects may be greater in people who are overweight as they tend to have insulin resistance and the actions of rosiglitazone may occur via its insulin-sensitizing effects. The effects may also be partially mediated via nitric oxide dependent mechanisms. We propose to study 12 obese and 12 non-obese subjects. They will be required to attend for three visits, the first of which will last for 30 min and the second and third for around 3 h each. The first visit will be a screening visit during which informed consent will be obtained and inclusion and exclusion criteria checked. Physical examination and medical history will be performed to ensure that it is safe for inclusion in the study. On the second and third visits, measurements of blood pressure, bio-impedance, forearm blood flow and arterial stiffness will be made (all non-invasive). Subjects will then be given a single oral dose of either rosiglitazone 8 mg or placebo. Two hours later, measurements of endothelial function will be made. A 27 gauge needle will be inserted into the left brachial artery under local anaethesia (1% lignocaine). Saline or drugs will be infused at a constant rate of 1.0 ml/min by means of a constant rate infusion pump throughout the duration of the study. Basal blood flow will be recorded after 18 min of 0.9% saline infusion. Acetylcholine will then be co-infused with saline at a dose of 7.5 and 15 ug/min, each dose at 1.0 ml/min for 6 min. There will then be a 18 min washout period during which saline infusion will be given. Sodium nitroprusside will then be co-infused with saline at a dose of 3 and 10 ug/min, each dose at 1.0 ml/min for 6 min. There will then be a further 18 min washout period with saline. L-NG-monomethyl-arginine (L-NMMA) will then be co-infused with saline at a dose of 4 then 8 umol/min, each dose at 1.0 ml/min for 6 min. Further measurements of forearm blood flow will be made during the last 2 min of each infusion period by venous occlusion plethysmography over 1 min. Blood flow will be measured every alternate 3 min for a 3 min period by intermittent inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the upper arm to 40 mmHg. A second cuff will be inflated around the wrist to a pressure of 200 mmHg during measurements of blood flow (maximum duration 3 min) in order to exclude the hand from the circulation during measurements. At the first visit subjects will also undergo measurement of Minimum Forearm Vascular Resistance (MFVR). In order to measure MFVR, a cuff will be inflated around the upper arm to a pressure of 300 mmHg to occlude arterial flow to the forearm for 13 min and then deflated and a measurement of forearm blood flow made by venous occlusion plethysmography. Arterial stiffness will be measured non-invasively using Pulse Wave Analysis (SphygmoCor, PWV Medical, Australia). This involves holding a small pressure sensitive probe against the skin overlying the radial, carotid and femoral arteries in turn. Following the assessment of endothelial function on the second and third visits, subjects will have baseline measurements of arterial stiffness repeated. They will then receive 400 micrograms of salbutamol by inhalation and after values have returned to baseline 500 micrograms of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) sublingually, with repeat measurements of arterial stiffness immediately after each drug is given. This will allow endothelial function in the large arteries to be assessed. The study will be conducted according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n\nThis trial has stopped due to lack of funding", "interventionType": "Drug", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": "Rosiglitazone"}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder5686-0", "contactId": "Contact6752_5686", "sponsorId": "Sponsor5287"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact6752_5686", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Ian B", "surname": "Wilkinson", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit\nLevel 3, ACCI\nBox 110\nAddenbrooke's NHS Trust", "city": "Cambridge", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "CB2 2QQ", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "+44 01223-336806"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "ibw20@cam.ac.uk"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor5287", "organisation": "Department of Health (UK)", "website": "http://www.doh.gov.uk", "sponsorType": "Government", "contactDetails": {"address": "Richmond House\n79 Whitehall", "city": "London", "state": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "SW1A 2NL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "funder": {"@id": "Funder5686-0", "name": "Cambridge Consortium - Addenbrooke's (UK)", "fundRef": null}}]}}
