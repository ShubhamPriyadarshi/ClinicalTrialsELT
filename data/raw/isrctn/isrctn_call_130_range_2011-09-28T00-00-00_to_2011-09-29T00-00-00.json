Location, size, and morphology of the culprit aneurysm are not believed to affect outcome in our institution.\n\nFollowing randomisation and start of trial therapy the clinical management of each patient will be as routine.

Although r-HuEPO has effects of erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis, associated deterioration or adverse events have not been observed in short-term treatment However, in the face of any abnormalities the trial drug will be stopped and the safety committee informed.
