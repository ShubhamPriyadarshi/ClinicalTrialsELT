To detect this kind of cancer in very early stages, modern radiological diagnostic methods are used. An important part is the monitoring of the patients after cancer treatment, and to predict the outcome of the disease, especially the early detection of local recurrence (cancer coming back) and distant metastases (spread of cancer to other parts of body). The goal of our research is the identification of the disease and monitoring of patients after treatment.\nWe want to evaluate with this study the safety and the functionality of a medical device, which is able to isolate circulating cancer cells from the bloodstream. A thin wire, also called nanodetector, is inserted into the bloodstream. The nanodetector has a special coating which has the ability to bind to cancer cells and thus to estimate the number of circulating tumor cells. This method has the advantage of identifying tumor cells in a much larger volume than a standard blood sample taken out of the body.\n\nWho can participate?\nYou are 18 years or older with lung cancer and you have not undergone surgery yet\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nIf you take part in the study, first of all, you will be asked to give a small sample of blood to test blood values for inclusion and exclusion into the study. Should you be eligible to participate the nanodetector will be inserted in the vein. The procedure of inserting the nanodetector is similar to inserting a small tube for blood collection and takes 30 min. This is a standard procedure in hospitals and medical practices. All patients in the study were treated in the same way. Afterwards you will be asked again to give a small sample of blood to check if blood values change after the insertion of the nanodetector. \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe cancer patients participating benefit from increased regular medical care, ranging from the provision of additional, non-routine blood tests.\nThe procedure is similar to a normal blood collection. Therefore the risk for the participants is comparable to the risk of a normal blood collection. All insertions of the nanodetector will be carried out by trained physicians. \n\nWhere is the study run from?\nThe study takes place at the Medical University in Poznan, Clinic for Thoracic Surgery, Poland\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nPatients have been enrolled since March 2010, and the study will end in March 2012. Until that time 60 subjects should be enrolled. \n\nWho is funding the study?\nThe study is being funded by the GILUPI company (Potsdam, Germany)\n\nWho is the main contact?\nStefanie Herold\nstefanie.herold@gilupi.com", "primaryOutcome": "1.

It has many causes including infectious and non-infectious. The objectives of this study were to add a gas called nitric oxide(NO) to the air that participants were breathing in order to raise the oxygen level in the blood in hopes of improving outcome in participants with ARDS.  \n\nWho can participate? \nPatients aged 18 and over, regardless of sex, who have ARDS and are on a breathing machine (called a ventilator) in order to  enable oxygen transfer into the blood.  \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThe study compared inhaled nitric oxide (INO) added to the air the patient was breathing though the machine  with a placebo nitrogen, a safe gas that makes up most of the air that we breathe and would have no effect on ARDS. All participants will receive the same treatment that they would have received for ARDS, even if they had not participated in the study.  If patients were randomly allocated to the group receiving inhaled nitric oxide, this would have been the additional therapy.  \n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nBy participating it is possible that the subject will have improved oxygenation and that this may lead to improved outcome. There are no anticipated potential side effects of the treatment when delivered at the doses that will be used in this study.  \n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThere were 35 centers taking part in this trial and the lead center is St. Johns Mercy Hospital St. Louis, Missouri.  \n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe start date of the study was  1996 and the duration of the study was approximately 3 years.

Gain in lean body mass (LBM) and greater decreases in fat mass (FM)\n2. Higher total daily energy expenditure (because of better preservation in LBM) and \n3. Better improvements in lipids and glucose homeostasis (because of better preservation in LBM and higher daily energy expenditure)", "plainEnglishSummary": "Background and study aims\nPrevious studies show that the percentage of obese female population at a given time is particularly high in women aged 50 to 75 years, in Canada and United States. The higher rate of occurence of obesity in postmenopausal women (PM) may be caused in part by the menopause transition; which is associated with changes in ovarian hormone status, decrease in energy expenditure, increase in fat mass (FM) and cardiovascular diseases risk factors. Part of this risk may be explained by changes in body composition and body fat distribution. PM women tend to gain fat mass mainly in the abdominal region, which is associated with lower insulin sensitivity (a condition where the natural hormone insulin, becomes less effective at lowering blood sugars). These metabolic changes, along with abnormal amount of cholesterol (dyslipidemia) and increased blood pressure (hypertension) are commonly associated with the metabolic syndrome and may predict type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease in PM women.   \nSeveral medical and behavioural approaches have been studied over the past decades in order to prevent or treat obesity. Still, caloric restriction (dietary regimen that restricts calorie intake) and physical activity are the main factors in prevention and treatment of obesity. \nThe aim of this study is to study the effects of caloric restriction alone or in combination with resistance training on body composition, body fat distribution, metabolic profile and energy expenditure in obese PM women, when taking into account animal protein intakes.\n\nWho can participate?\n100 postmenopausal women (60-75 yrs and body mass index between 27 and 40 kg/m\u00b2) \n\nWhat does the study involve?\nSubjects will be randomised in one of the 4 groups:\n1. Standard hypocaloric diet\n2. Standard hypocaloric diet + resistance training\n3. Standard hypocaloric diet + animal proteins supplement and\n4. Standard hypocaloric diet + animal proteins supplement + resistance training.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nSubjects will receive:\n1. Professional supervision regarding nutrition and/or exercise during the study (depending on the treatment group)\n2. Professional advises and recommendations regarding nutrition and exercise following the study based on personal results before and after the study\n3. Improvements in body composition, body fat distribution and the metabolic profile (blood pressure, lipids and glucose blood levels and\n4. Improvements in physical capacity. At the end of the study, each subject will receive a personalized document including data regarding body composition, metabolic, physical capacity and nutrition changes during the study. \n\nThe participation to an exercise program involves a risk of injuries which we intend to minimize by creating a progressive protocol. In addition to that, the exercise sessions will be supervised. The exposition to X-rays during DXA (from 0.03 to 0.05 millirem) is comparable to 20 minutes of sun exposition. The principal investigator has several reasons to believe that the advantages to participate in the study overcomes the risks.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nSherbrooke: Centre for Research on Aging, Center for Health and Social Services of the University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke (CRV - CSSS-IUGS) and Montreal: Clinical Research Institute of Montreal (IRCM)\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nThe project is expected to start in January 2012. The anticipated end date is January 2014.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)\n\nWho is the main contact?\nProf Martin Brochu\nMartin.Brochu@USherbrooke.ca", "primaryOutcome": "1. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology to measure total fat mass, bone mass and lean body mass as well as each tissue by region (trunk, legs and arms). \n2. Other measures of body composition include weight, height, waist and hip circumferences. They are taken before, during and after the intervention (total of 3 times for DXA outcomes and 8 times for other body composition measurements).", "secondaryOutcome": "1. Lipids, glucose homeostasis, inflammation profile, adipokines, energy expenditure, resting arterial blood pressure and heart rate, physical capacity and psychosocial determinants\n2. Plasma measures will be taken before, during and after the intervention (total of 3 times): Analyses will be done on the COBAS INTEGRA 400 (Roche Diagnostic, Montr\u00e9al, Canada) analyzer for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose combined with specific cassettes containing in vitro diagnostic reagent system. LDL-cholesterol concentration will be calculated by Friedewald equation using total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. \n2.1. Insulin and IGF-I concentrations will be determined with commercially available radioimmunoassay kits (Radioassay System Laboratory, and ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA; distributed by Immunocorp, Montreal, PQ, and Diagnostic Systems aboratories-2900, respectively). \n2.2. Plasma IGFBP-1,2,3 will be determined by Western blotting. \n2.3. Serum adiponectin and leptin (Linco Research, St-Charles, MO, USA) levels will be measured in duplicate with a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA) procedure using 125I-labeled bioactive human adiponectin and leptin as tracers and a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against full-length peptides. \n2.4. Plasma immunoreactive total and acylated ghrelin levels will be measured in duplicate with a commercial RIA using 125I-labeled bioactive human acylated ghrelin as tracers and rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against full-length total ghrelin and against the Ser3-octanoylated portion of acylated ghrelin, respectively (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). \n2.5. Nonacylated ghrelin values will be calculated as total minus acylated ghrelin. NPY will be measured by RIA kits (Peninsula Lab., Belniont, CA) after plasma extraction on reverse-phase minicolunins. CRP will be measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on purified protein and polyclonal anti-CRP antibodies (sensitivity: 0.08 \u00b5g/ml and interassay coefficient of variation: 8.0%) (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). \n2.6. An ELISA will be used to measure IL-6, using commercial kits (detectable limit: 0.10 pg/ml and interassay coefficient of variation: 10.3%) (Quantikine, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Values will be measured in duplicate, and the average will be reported for both assays. Other metabolic variables for screening will be follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), HBA1c, creatinin, haptoglobin and Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).\n3. Glucose homeostasis will be measured before and after the intervention (total of 2 times). A 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed in the morning after a 12-hour fast, as recommended. Blood samples will be collected through a venous catheter from an antecubital vein in vacutainer tubes containing Trasylol (Miles, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada) and EDTA, at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Plasma insulin concentrations will be determined by radioimmunoassay using polyethylene glycol separation and glucose levels will be measured enzymically.\n4. Measures of energy expenditure include the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the metabolic cost of walking at different paces, both measured by indirect calorimetry. Measurement of gas concentrations will be used to determine 24h RMR using the equation of Weir. These measures will be taken before, during and after the intervention (total of 2 times).\n5. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate will be measured in sitting position. First, resting values for each visit will be determined as the average of the last four readings of five (one per min) from a Dinamap (Critikon, Johnson & Johnson, Tampa, FL) automatic machine. Measurements will be performed at different visits before, during and after the intervention (total of 8 times). An appropriate cuff size will be selected for each subject based on arm circumference\n6. Physical capacity measures include climbing stairs, standing on one leg, hand grip strength and the 6-min walk test. These measures will be taken before and after the intervention (2 times)\n7.

Patients may have a combinations of physical, communicative, cognitive, behavioural, psychosocial and environmental problems. Rehabilitation is a problem-solving educational process aimed at reducing the disability experienced as a result of disease or injury. The rehabilitation will be personal, social, and physical. Different individuals will need different programs of rehabilitation and they will need different programs of rehabilitation at different stages in their recovery.\n\nProblems of balance are among the most frequent problems treated by physical therapists in patients with ABI. Several studies conclude that the use of programs in which patients have a cognitive or motor task (store a sequence of numbers or manipulate objects) while keeping their balance are more effective. Scientific research recommends rehabilitation for long periods and in everyday situations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based program, without direct guidance of physiotherapist, in addition to traditional physical therapy.\n\nWho can participate?\nParticipants were of working age (between 18 and 55 years old) and suffering from ABI.

The learnings of this study can inform health officials, global health policy makers and funders about the costs and ultimate health benefits of investing in reliable transportation.\n\nWho can participate? \nThis study does not directly involve human subjects/participants. Our target population is motorcycles and vehicles used for health delivery. \n\nWhat does the study involve? \nEight districts in the Southern Province of Zambia are included in the study.

The Riders intervention in the four experimental districts will be the \"Transport Asset Management (TAM)\" program. These districts receive vehicles and motorcycles as well as maintenance and repair services.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nThere are no risks to participants as the study does not involve patients but health technicians and transport managers.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nThe study is run by the Socially and Environmentally Supply Chains Program at Stanford University's Global Supply Chain Management Forum, which is based at the University's Graduate School of Business. \n\nWhen did the study start and how long is it expected to run for?\nBaseline data collection began on August 1, 2011  and the study is expected to continue through summer 2013.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nThe study is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA.\n\nWho is the main contact?\nSonali Rammohan\nrammohan_sonali@gsb.stanford.edu", "primaryOutcome": "Environmental Health Technician productivity and health intervention coverage rates", "secondaryOutcome": "No secondary outcome measures", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "1.

Variations in the design of peritoneal catheters include different numbers of cuffs (single vs double), different shapes of subcutaneous paths (permanently-bent Swan  neck catheter vs straight Tenckhoff catheter) and different shapes of intra-abdominal  segments (straight vs coiled).\n\nA recent systematic review demonstrated that the benefits of  various design types have been studied poorly.Most published studies are limited by a small  sample size and various design problems, such as lack of stratification by surgeon and  presence of several interventions (eg. single vs double cuff, Swan-Neck vs Tenckhoff,  Moncrief-Popovich vs conventional insertion technique, median vs lateral insertion site, etc). As a result, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) is unable to provide  definitive guidelines for catheter choice. Moreover, most studies have been performed in  Caucasians, and there is general lack of data relevant to Asian populations.  It is generally  believed that this design allows for less dialysate inflow pain and less propensity for catheter  migration. However, two recent studies have suggested that coiled catheters may be  associated with a greater rate of drainage dysfunction due to catheter tip migration and may  require replacement more frequently compared to straight catheters. These observations  prompted our randomised controlled trial (RCT) with the primary hypothesis that coiled-end  catheters may be more prone to catheter tip migration and resultant catheter dysfunction.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Catheter tip migration defined as catheter tip located above the pelvic brim on the abdominal X-ray with associated catheter dysfunction", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

The oocytes that had released the first polar body (metaphase II - MII) underwent a strict selection by morphological features (zona pellucida thickness, perivitelline space size, oocyte shape, cytoplasm colour and granularity, presence of vacuoles and first polar body morphology). Immediately after decumulation and quality evaluation, the high quality MII oocytes were put in progressively-numbered culture droplets and randomised for ICSI; the supernumerary sibling MII oocytes were vitrified.Since at the beginning of this study the Italian IVF law allowed the injection of maximum three oocytes (Benagiano and Gianaroli, 2004), between April 2008 and 8 April2009 three MII oocytes were randomised for ICSI and the supernumerary sibling oocytes were vitrified. Randomisation was performed by a different embryologist to the operator who performed oocyte denudation using a specific software (www.randomizer.org). Since 9 April 2009 - due to changes in the Italian law (Benagiano and Gianaroli, 2010) - the number of oocytes to randomise for ICSI or vitrification has been defined following our centre\u0092s guideline based on: female age at oocyte recovery and  semen parameters, but generally not more than 6 oocytes are injected. \n\nOnly the first warming cycle per patient was included in the study: from the beginning of the study to 8 April 2009 maximum 3 random warmed oocytes were injected by ICSI; from 9 April 2009 the number of warmed oocytes to inject has defined following our centre\u0092s guideline. \n\nLN2 sterilisation via UV irradiation was performed by administration of 660,000 \u00b5W/cm2.\n\nCryotop (Kitazato BioPharma Co, Fuji-Shizuoka, Japan) oocyte vitrification was performed at room temperature in a 'home made' solution comprising 15% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO- D 2438 Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 15% ethylene glycol (EG \u0096 10.246-6 Sigma Aldrich) and 0.5 mol/L sucrose (Sigma Aldrich), after a gradual initial equilibration of 15 minutes in a solution comprising 7.5% DMSO and 7.5% EG (Kuwayama et al, 2005, Rienzi et al., 2009). For the ultra-rapid cooling, the Cryotops - containing 1-2 oocytes- were plunged into UV-sterilised LN2 . and closed with their plastic caps. Then, the Cryotops of each patient were enclosed in 'home made' hermetical aluminium cylindric containers (high security goblets). which can contain up to 6 Cryotops each. These goblets had been previously submerged vertically in LN2 in order to avoid the infiltration of LN2 and checked for an inner temperature of -196\u00b0 C at the end of UV-sterilisation process. The Cryotops were inserted into the 'high security goblets' taking care to keep the Cryotop strip containing the oocyte in the nitrogen vapour phase above the LN2. Finally, the goblets were hermetically closed with sterilised caps and polipropilene adhesive tape (Scotch\u00ae 3M Italia, Pioltello MI, Italy).\n\nBefore the rapid warming, the hermetical goblets containing the Cryotops were opened into the UV-sterilised LN2. The caps of the Cryotops were removed in the LN2, and each open carrier was submerged in 1 mL of warming solution containing 1 M sucrose at 37\u00b0 C. Then, the oocytes were incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes first in 0.5 M and subsequently in 0.25 M and finally washed for 4 minutes in basic medium (PBS \u0096 D8662 Sigma Aldrich, supplemented with 20% EHSA Conception Tecnologies, San Diego CA, USA) before culture. Warmed oocytes were considered to have survived in absence of negative characteristics: dark or contracted ooplasm, vacuolization, cytoplasmic leakage, abnormal perivitelline space, cracked zona pellucida.

AZA and 6-MP are well established in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have proven to be effective in both inducing and maintaining remission of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) with an efficacy rate of 55 - 70%. Unfortunately, thiopurine drugs have to be withdrawn in 10 - 30% of cases due to serious side effects, such as bone marrow toxicity and hepatotoxicity. Both efficacy and toxicity of these drugs are hard to be predicted in the long-term treatment.\n\nAfter one oral dose, AZA is rapidly converted to 6-MP and an imidazole derivative, but up to 12% of the dose can be split to form the purine base hypoxanthine and thioimidazole. Three enzymes compete to metabolize 6-MP: xanthine oxidase (XO), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). 6-MP activation, catalysed by HPRT, forms initially the 6-MP nucleotides and eventually the active metabolites, the thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs). The TGN metabolites act as purine antagonists and induce cytotoxicity and immunosuppression by inhibition of rubinucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and protein synthesis. These cytotoxic properties are, at least partially, due to the direct incorporation of TGN into deoxyribonucleic acid.\n\nThe observed inter-individual differences in therapeutic response or toxicity of AZA treatment were partly explained by the variable formation of active metabolites because of genetic polymorphisms of the genes encoding crucial enzymes in thiopurine metabolism. These enzymes include TPMT, XO, HPRT, inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA). Clinical trials have also demonstrated that 6-TGNs levels were associated with clinical efficacy and toxicity of AZA/6-MP. However, most of these trials were performed in western countries with a retrospective design or a short-time follow-up.\n\nOn the basis of our previous studies and reports from other researchers, we propose the following hypotheses:\n1. The polymorphisms of thiopurine drugs' metabolism enzymes were associated with clinical efficacy and adverse effects of AZA/6-MP in Chinese IBD patients\n2. There is a safe and therapeutic concentration threshold of 6-TGNs in patients with undergoing AZA/6-MP therapy\n3.

Patients will be randomly assigned to 12 monthly support group meetings or \u0091usual care\u0092 control. \u0091Usual care\u0092 is defined as continuing to attend all normal GP, consultant or clinic appointments without additional study intervention. All potential participants (see Subjects below) will receive a letter briefly outlining the study along with how and why they have been contacted to participate. All patients will also be sent an information sheet containing a detailed description of the study, a brief questionnaire confirming eligibility and a \u0091freepost\u0092 envelope. Participants will be requested to complete the questionnaire and return it in the enclosed \u0091freepost\u0092 envelope if they are interested in taking part.\n\nOnce a potential participant has expressed an interest in taking part in the study and their eligibility is confirmed, patients will attend a study visit. All study visits will take place in a quiet, private room on a one-to-one basis, where the project will be fully explained and any questions answered. All aspects of the support group will be described in detail, including the considerable commitment required to participate in such a program. The nature of the usual care arm of the study will also be fully explained. Patients will be advised that their GP will be informed of their participation in the trial at their request. All participants will give written informed consent using the consent form approved by the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust Ethics Committee.\n\nFollowing consent, patients will be randomly assigned to either 12 monthly support group meetings or usual care control for the same 12 month period. Randomisation will be performed using identical opaque brown sealed envelopes containing an equal number of paper strips marked \u0091Support Group\u0092 or \u0091Usual Care\u0092. The envelopes will be shuffled in front of the patient, who will then be asked to pick one from the pile. The patient will open the envelope themselves to discover their group assignment.\n\nFollowing randomisation, all participants will be guided through and asked to complete a study questionnaire (see Questionnaire section below), exploring their current quality of life, anxiety, depression, social support and social contact, along with health recourse utilisation over the previous two years. All participants will be requested to complete the same questionnaire after six and twelve months of support group participation or usual care. Support group participants will receive the additional questionnaires during the group meeting to complete at home and return in a 'freepost' envelope provided. Usual care control group members will receive and return the six and twelve month questionnaires by post using the 'freepost' envelope provided.\n\nThe support group will consist of 12 monthly group meetings. The groups will be comprised of no more than 20 patients, in order to provide a supportive environment small enough to encourage full interaction, in line with current support group recommendations (1). Groups will be held at both the Royal Brompton and Harefield sites in order to reflect the geographical location of the majority of our patient population. Groups will run for approximately 90 minutes at a time and day most suitable to the majority of the participants.\n\nAt the first group meeting, the support group goals, aims and ethic will be explained in detail, allowing plenty of time for input from the group. The monthly meetings will be designed to reflect the needs of the participants involved. Participants will be asked to indicate what they hope to get out of the support group, what topics they would like to learn more about, or what activities they would like to undertake, thus empowering the participants with a sense of group ownership and responsibility. It is envisaged that guest speakers will address the group on associated topics every other month, with the interim meetings providing and opportunity for discussion, reflection and support. Presentations from guest speakers will include:\n1. An overview of Syndrome X given by Prof Peter Collins, a recognised expert in the field\n2. The importance of physical activity and exercise, given by a Harefield\nHospital physiotherapist experienced in exercising patients with Syndrome X\n3. Learning to relax to avoid pain, given by Dr Nasim Kanji, a practitioner of Autogenic Training\n4. \u0091Ask an expert\u0092 forum with Dr John Stevenson, a gynaecologist and authority in hormone replacement therapy and Syndrome X\n5. Other guest speaker and topics for discussion will be motivated by the participant\u0092s interests.\n\nSupport group ethic. In order to promote an atmosphere of tolerance, understanding and mutual respect, in line with other long-established support groups (The Wellington ME / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Support Group, Wellington, New Zealand), the following ethic will be applied to the Syndrome X group:\n1. Confidentiality - whatever is said in the meeting room stays in the room\n2. Respect other people\u0092s views and beliefs - remember everyone is different what works for one person may or may not necessarily work for another.\n3. One person speaks at a time - common courtesy and politeness\n4. Participants can reveal as much or as little as they feel comfortable with\n5. A question and answer session will always follow any presentation by a guest speaker If the participant has any complaints or suggestions about the way the meeting or group is run, they should contact the group leader (EA)\n6. If the participant wants to suggest a guest speaker or specific topic, they should talk to the group leader (EA)\nThis ethic will be introduced to the participants during the first meeting and reinforced throughout the duration of the support group.\n\nSyndrome X patients with chest pain, a positive exercise ECG stress-test for myocardial ischaemia and angiographically smooth coronary arteries who have expressed an interest in participating in any previous research study will be invited to participate in the study. This number totals approximately 200 patients, all of whom will be approached to participate by post. Further Syndrome X patients will be approached from the Women\u0092s Heart Clinic at the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Trust (London, United Kingdom). The Women\u0092s Heart Clinic is a specialised clinic for Syndrome X patients run by Prof. Peter Collins. All patients with Syndrome X will be invited to participate in the study, regardless of gender or additional illness.\n\nThe Health Anxiety Questionnaire (2) (HAQ) has been developed using the cognitive behavioural model of anxiety (3), which divides health anxiety into two parts: development and maintenance. The HAQ is split into four sub-scales that focus on: health worry preoccupation; fear of illness and death; reassurance seeking behaviour and interference with life. Developed and validated in medical, psychiatric and healthy volunteers (2), the 22 questions have a four-point Likert scale response format.\n\nThe Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (4) (HADS) measures clinically significant anxiety and depression in general medical patients. The 14-item questionnaire is split in to two sub-scales (anxiety and depression) using a four-point Likert scales response format. Anxiety and depression scales have also been combined to create a total score (5). The scale has been validated with both outpatients and inpatients (6), along with NCCP patients (7).\n\nThe SF-36 (8) is a general health questionnaire divided into different aspects of quality of life: physical role limitation, emotional role limitation, physical functioning, pain, general health and energy. The SF-36 is a commonly used tool in quality of life research and has previously been used with Cardiac Syndrome X patients (9). \n\nA demographic information scale (10) will be used to assess social interaction by recording the patients living circumstances, frequency of contact with friends and relatives and size of social network. This measure investigates the frequency contact with adults, both outside and within the normal household, differentiating between friends and family along with identifying any specific confidant. The four reported levels represent the following frequencies of social contact: 1) every day; 2) three times per week; 3) once a week; or 4) once a month.\n\nThe ENRICHD Social Support Instrument (ESSI) (11) was developed for use with post acute MI patients. The seven item scale assesses four key attributes of social support: emotional, instrumental, informational and appraisal. The ESSI has also been validated among cardiac patients undergoing angioplasty (12).\n\nThe York Angina Beliefs (13) is designed to uncover the patient\u0092s beliefs and possible misconceptions regarding chest pain symptoms and dyspnoea. Inaccurate health beliefs can drastically influence behaviour, leading in inactivity and reinforced illness perceptions. The York Angina Beliefs Scale has been designed for use in both the clinical and research environment.\n\nParticipants will also be asked about any known family history of CHD, their current medications, hospitalisations and clinical consults relating to Syndrome X over the past two years, along with their current level of physical activity.\n\nThe data will be analysed using one-way ANOVA, paired and independent Students\u0092 t-tests, Pearson\u0092s Correlation and ANCOVA to determine between group effects while controlling for baseline variation; overall comparisons of categorical data will be performed using Chi-square test. Statistical significance level is set at p<0.05. In order to ensure a minimum 80% power, data from a previous large-scale cross-sectional study (14) has been employed to establish the necessary sample size using the standard calculation and normogram (15). The following assumptions were made for all the power calculations: 5% significance level, 80% power to detect a difference between groups, randomisation to the two groups in equal proportions. From the previous data (14) using these parameters, it has been calculated that a total sample size of 60 (30 patients in each group) would determine the impact of support group participation on psychological morbidity, health beliefs, quality of life and health resource utilisation in patients with Cardiac Syndrome X.\n\nReference List:\n1.

Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2000, 161:1942-1948).\n9. Retrospective consent to take part in study, and to use retained specimens for research. Several models of consent have been applied to patients receiving intensive care. All, however, contain difficult issues regarding the competency of these patients to give informed consent at the proposed point of enrolment into the study. Following discussion with Dr C Counsell (R&D Support), we propose that Bronchoscopy/BAL is in the best interests of patients as it provides the best method of obtaining samples for microbiological analysis from the lungs of ventilated patients. Furthermore, BAL would form part of the routine investigative work-up for patients suspected of having VAP. In addition, BAL is recommended in severe ALI/ARDS to exclude sepsis prior to the commencement of systemic corticosteroids (Meduri GU, Chinn AJ, Leeper KV et al: Corticosteroid rescue treatment of progressive fibroproliferation in late ARDS: patterns of response and predictors of outcome. Chest 1994, 105:1516-1527). Therefore, informed consent for inclusion into the study, storage of patient data and storage of biological specimens for subsequent analysis will be sought retrospectively from patients after recruitment. Patients will also be asked to provide consent to attend a three month post-Intensive Care Unit (ICU) follow up clinic for assessment of functional outcomes and health status\n10.

The primary mechanism of death in warm shock is low blood pressure, which leads to inadequate blood and oxygen supply to vital organs. Multiple drugs have been used to control blood pressure and reverse shock, however patients often remain resistant to these medications. Hence side effects of these drugs are often seen, before their proposed effect occurs. Vasopressin, a drug which has been used for over 50 years for other conditions, has recently been shown to improve blood pressure in shock, where other drugs have failed. It appears to act directly to reverse the underlying mechanisms of shock, and has additional advantages over traditionally used medications. We are conducting a study to examine if vasopressin is effective and safe to use in critically ill children who suffer from warm shock.\n\nPlease note that as of 20/12/2007 this trial record was extensively updated with information from the funder, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
