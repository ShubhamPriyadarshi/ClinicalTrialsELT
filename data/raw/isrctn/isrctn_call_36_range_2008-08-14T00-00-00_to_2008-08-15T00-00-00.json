The latest American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy guidelines endorsed thromboprophylaxis after knee arthroscopy with low-molecular weight heparins (LMWH) only in patients with pre-existing risk factors or with prolonged or complicated procedures; while suggesting against routine thromboprophylaxis other than early mobilisation in all other patients (both grade 2B recommendations). Conversely, in Italy there is a very high prescription-rate of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis after KA procedures, although with a great heterogeneity in terms of timing and duration.\n\nAdded 14/08/2008:\nOriginally the study had been designed as a triple-arm trial, including a 14-day LMWH course.

Randomisation is being used because one discharge coordinator would not be able to provide care for all eligible patients and it is unclear from the literature how this intervention should be targeted. Allocation will be concealed.\n\nAll four Clinical Teaching Units (CTUs) at this hospital will participate in this study. Letters inviting participation in this study will be sent from the General Internal Medicine Program Director to all medicine residents assigned to the CTUs during the study period. Letters of invitation will also be sent from the General Internal Medicine Division Director to all staff physicians who will be attending on the medicine CTUs during the study period. Notification of the study will be provided to all members of the health care teams on the medical wards.\n\nThe research assistant will continue to attend bullet rounds each morning to identify eligible patients. The discharge coordinator will only be present from 9 am to 5 pm on Monday to Friday. Once eligible patients are identified, a research assistant will approach them for consent to participate as outlined above. If patients agree to participate, baseline demographics will be obtained. We will also attempt to collect baseline information from patients who decline the invitation to participate in the trial and determine why they are not interested in participating in the study. Once the consent has been obtained, the patient will be randomised and the discharge coordinator will be notified by the research assistant if the patient has been allocated to that intervention.\n\nDischarge planning should include assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring phases. Those patients assigned to the discharge coordinator will receive an assessment of their supports, financial situation, living situation, medical and functional status. Data collection forms that will be used were developed in consultation with a former case manager on a neurosurgical unit and members of the allied health care team. Functional status will be assessed using the Barthel Index. Elicitation of this information will be done in collaboration with the patient; their caregivers, physicians, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, nurses and home care coordinators.\n\nThe discharge coordinator will work with the patient and health care team (including the home care coordinator) to identify a discharge date, and to coordinate supports, medications, follow-up tests and appointments upon discharge. Information about the diagnosis and ongoing management of the patients will be shared with the patient and their caregivers and with their family physician who will provide ongoing care.\n\nColleagues with expertise in human factors engineering and the development of consumer educational materials will assist in the preparation of the patient-centred materials. Patient materials will also be translated into Cantonese and Portuguese, reflecting the multicultural mix of patients admitted to the Toronto Western Hospital. This will be done to ensure that both written and verbal information is provided to patients.\n\nThe discharge coordinator will prepare the discharge summary with the physician responsible for caring for the patient focusing on the list of medications, and a description of the management plan in hospital and after discharge. The discharge coordinator will also coordinate arrangements for homecare and will disseminate relevant information about the discharge plan to the patient, caregiver, attending physician, medical house-staff and family physician. They will also provide a follow-up telephone call to the patient 48 hours and two weeks after discharge to determine if any medical issues have arisen that need attention or if any problems with follow-up have occurred. Additional referrals to appropriate services (including home care) will be made at that time as necessary.
