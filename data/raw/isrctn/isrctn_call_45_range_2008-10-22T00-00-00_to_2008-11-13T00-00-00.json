Preserving the temporal stem (subtemporal approach) results in a better crosstalk between frontal executive and temporal memory functions. Therefore memory aspects of organisation, differentiation, recognition (source memory) theoretically can be expected to be better preserved after the subtemporal approach as compared to the transsylvian approach.\n2. Partial disconnection of the temporal stem (transsylvian approach) is possibly expected to result in a more pronounced effect of reward learning as the importance of the functional connection between temporal and frontal structures for this function has been discussed recently\n3. The relevance of cognitive development and seizure control for quality of life and their implication for the patients' every day life are another topic of interest.

Verbal learning and memory: two parallel versions of a pre- and post-operative Verbal Learning Test (VLMT- Verbaler Lern- und Merkf\u00e4higkeitstest).

While these symptoms will disappear with the cessation of GnRH agonist treatment (e.g. Zoladex\u00ae), the other side effect, Bone Mineral Density (BMD) loss, may completely reverse its effects after treatment has been discontinued. Women may turn towards another drug therapy to minimise their menopausal-type symptoms and their amount of bone loss. When used in small doses, this \u0091add-back therapy\u0092 does not impact on the effectiveness of the GnRHa. \n\nWithout an established combination therapy regimen, women should be provided with alternatives for restoring their BMD to their pre-treatment values. In addition, as it becomes increasingly apparent that health care companies are looking to reign in the costs provided to treat an aging populations\u0092 plethora of diseases and conditions, it is necessary to continue combing the industry for safe, effective and economical alternatives - this study will investigate the safety and potential effectiveness of one of two forms of interferential stimulation to serve as such an alternative.\n\nOf utmost importance when prescribing any therapeutic regimen is the physician\u0092s ability to safeguard patients\u0092 safety and well-being, and to diminish the potential side effects of those therapies. GnRHa presents significant and sometimes irreversible side effects. For this reason, the use of interferential stimulation as a safe and non-invasive therapy to potentially minimise or eliminate the associated BMD loss in pre-menopausal, hypo-estrogenic women treated with GnRHa therapy should be considered and is the basis for this study.\n\nAssuming that it is possible for interferential (external electric) stimulation to further minimise or eliminate BMD loss in hypo-estrogenic, pre-menopausal women receiving GnRHa, this study will support the need to continue researching the potential role of electrical stimulation in osteogenesis. Diseases such as osteoporosis, the most common bone disease worldwide, could definitely benefit from such research, with direct costs of osteoporotic fractures in the United States at approximately $17 billion in 2001. Osteoporosis poses a major risk for fracture, which leads to considerable morbidity, mortality, and expense worldwide. The cost of all osteoporotic fractures in Europe was estimated at \u008031.7 billion in 2000, and the total cost of osteoporosis in Australia has been estimated at $7.4 billion per year (International Osteoporosis Foundation). These costs demonstrate the need to introduce additional, safe, effective, and economical alternatives for the treatment of osteoporosis; electrical stimulation, namely interferential stimulation, may serve as an alternate form of treatment for this therapeutic area as well.\n\nAdded as of 11/11/2008: Please note that this trial was prematurely terminated on 04/11/2008 due to low patient recruitment.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "The principal research objective is to evaluate the safety of interferential stimulation when used by pre-menopausal women who are hypo-oestrogenic as a result of taking a GnRH agonist when compared to a control group (standard of care only).

This will serve as the basis for assessment of the patients in the present study. The thickness changes of the deep trunk muscles will be assessed using the procedure described by Richardson et. al., which takes about 15 to 30 minutes to complete. \n\nThe measurements will be made using a Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine with a linear array transducer (5 - 12 MHz). The transducer will firstly be fixed in a custom-made foam block to prevent tilting and to control the pressure applied during the assessment. It will then be positioned at a point 2.5 cm anteromedial to the mid-point between the iliac crest and the costal margin on the mid-axillary line, where the fascial boundaries of the Transversus Abdominis (TA), Internal Oblique (IO) and External Oblique (EO) lie parallel. A gel standoff pad (Sonar Aid) and transmission gel will be placed between the transducer head and the skin to permit good signal transmission. To minimise the relative movement between the transducer and the abdomen, the foam block will be fixed around the abdomen using Velcro straps. \n\nMeasurements will be made with the patient firstly in a supine position, with a relaxed abdomen (and with hips flexed to 45\u00b0and knees flexed to 90\u00b0), and then during the performance of a \u0091stomach drawing-in\u0092 exercise (abdominal hollowing), with the contraction being held for at least ten seconds. The patients will firstly receive instructions on how to perform the test-exercise and will be given a short time to practice before the instrumentation is attached and the measurements begin. \n\nFive trials will be carried out on each of the right and left sides. All scanner settings for the ultrasound will be kept constant except for the depth, focus and gain, which will be adjusted for each individual to permit optimal ultrasound quality. M-mode grey-scale images, superimposed with Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) signals, will be sampled at approximately 300 Hz and exported to the computer to which the ultrasound machine is interfaced, for off-line analyses. \n\nHDI-Lab (an analysis programme provided by Philips\u0092 for research purposes only) will be used for determination of abdominal muscle thickness changes during the test contractions. The fascial boundaries of the muscles of interest are firstly marked with a cursor at regular intervals along the full length of the M-mode image, in order to guide an edge-detection programme. The latter takes advantage of the TDI velocity information to derive the displacement of a given point between two adjacent M-mode columns (displacement being equal to tissue velocity multiplied by the time difference between adjacent M-mode columns). \n\nOnce the fascial borders have been identified, the vertical distance between two fasciae (i.e. the muscle thickness) for every sampling point in time (i.e., every 0.003 s), and for each muscle, is then calculated and exported as a text file into Excel. From here, a custom-made programme written in Labview is used to identify the resting muscle thickness (average over a one second period prior to contraction), the maximum TA thickness (maximum average value over any given three second period during the test contraction) and the IO and EO thicknesses at the point of maximum TA thickness. The proportional increase in TA thickness and the concomitant changes in IO and EO thicknesses will be used to classify the ability to selectively activate TA.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder15917-0", "contactId": "Contact53861_15917", "sponsorId": "Sponsor52412"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact53861_15917", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Haiko", "surname": "Sprott", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Department of Rheumatology and Institute of Physical Medicine\nUniversity Hospital Zurich\nGloriastrasse 25", "city": "Zurich", "country": "Switzerland", "zip": "CH-8091", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "#text": "haiko.sprott@usz.ch"}}, "privacy": "Public"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor52412", "organisation": "Swiss National Science Foundation (Switzerland)", "website": "http://www.snf.ch/default_en.asp", "sponsorType": "Research organisation", "contactDetails": {"address": "Address Headquarters \nWildhainweg 3\nP.O.

Condition a + goal setting + psychological treatment by means of a tailored self-help manual and group meetings. In a motivational interview at baseline (1 hour) patients are motivated for weight management, through an active lifestyle and modified eating patterns, and are motivated to set a personal relevant health and social goal which relates to weight loss. Trained health psychologists will help patients set these goals by means of a goal setting procedure similar to those developed by Williams and colleagues. Most relevant health goals related to weight reduction are eating healthily and exercise.\n\nOne week after the motivational interview, patients will be sent a brief summary of their stated goals. Patients are given the opportunity to specify or modify the goals that were formulated in the interview. Patients will be asked to bring the summary of their goals to the first group meeting two weeks after the motivational interview.\n\nThe group meetings (10 patients per group) involve self regulatory strategies directed at achieving the personal relevant health and social goal related to weight loss. In group meetings and home assignments self regulatory processes are discussed and applied to personal relevant barriers in the achievement of the weight loss goals. The summary of the patients' formulated goals in the motivational interview will serve as a basis for the group meetings. During the group meetings (and the home assignments) this summary will be worked out to a goal scheme in which processes and steps are formulated that facilitate achievement of patients' health and social goal.\n\nIn the first part of the group meetings there is time to discuss patients' experiences and feelings with regard to goal progress and barriers to goal progress. This part will also facilitate patients' skills to ensure social support from the environment (partner, buddy system, family members and friends).\n\nAll group sessions are offered by a psychologist. Group sessions will be offered during the daytime as well as during the evenings. Psychologists will provide an additional telephone structure after the first two months of the intervention (1 x 10 minute phone call every month).\n\nA diabetes manual, based on principles for self regulatory interventions will help the diabetes patients regulate their behaviour at home and continue the programme in the absence of a group meeting. The manual consists of an information part with information regarding exercise, healthy eating, stress induced eating, medication and self-testing and an assignment part in which patients are challenged and motivated to apply self regulatory principles of behaviour change to themselves.\n\nThe information part will contain general diabetes and weight relevant information partly derived from the Diabetes Manual (UK; see condition c). The assignment part will contain self-regulation based exercises which are tailored to the patients' self-chosen health and personal goals. Exercises will help patients move toward goal achievement and motivate them for behaviour change on a weekly basis. The manuals will be piloted on readability, lay-out, and understanding.\n\nc.

The manual which is based on the validated Heart Manual has been developed and piloted in the UK. The English version of the Diabetes Manual has been translated into Dutch and will be piloted on readability, lay-out, understanding and cultural influences. The twelve week programme in the booklet is divided into 6 stages which include topics such as exercise initiation and maintenance, healthy eating and coping with stress. Aim to the twelve week programme is to enhance the patients' self-efficacy for engaging in diabetes-related behaviours through mastery experiences, information provision, record keeping, responding to biomedical feedback, goal setting and achievement.
