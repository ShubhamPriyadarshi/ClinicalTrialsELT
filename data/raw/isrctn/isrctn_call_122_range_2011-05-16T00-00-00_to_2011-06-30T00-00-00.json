Prebiotics are compounds that cannot be utilised by enzymes of the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans but that are fermented selectively by some types of intestinal bacteria that reside in the large intestine, thereby exerting a beneficial health effect on their host. Ingestion of prebiotics causes a shift in the composition of the intestinal bacterial population, typically characterised by a relative increase in certain beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium species. This shift in the intestinal microbiota and the associated fermentation activities, typically involving increased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), are associated with improved overall health, reduced gut infections, better absorption of minerals and suppression of colon cancer initiation.\n\nThe study product of this study was bread made by addition of endoxylanase enzymes to a flour mixture derived from wheat and rye, resulting in the generation of arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) during the bread making process. \n\nThe primary objectives were to assess whether intake of the AXOS-enriched bread alters the levels of  microbiota in the faeces, in particular faecal bifidobacteria and whether it has an effect on the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the faeces, a hallmark of beneficial prebiotic effects. \n\nThe study also aimed at investigating the effect of consumption of AXOS-enriched bread on phenol and p-cresol content in urine, markers of colonic protein fermentation. In addition, the study was also set up to investigate, through the use of questionnaires, whether consumption of AXOS-enriched bread affects stool frequency, stool consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms. \n\nWheat flour bread without in situ produced AXOS (during run in and wash out periods) and fibre enriched bread without in situ produced AXOS were used as references.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Total short chain fatty acid concentrations in faeces were significantly higher upon consumption of WR+ (wheat/rye bread with in situ produced AXOS) compared to intake of W- (wheat flour bread without in situ produced AXOS).

To each container (5 liter volume) for urine collection dispensed to the subjects by members of the investigational team, 1.0 g neomycine was added to prevent bacterial growth. Subjects delivered the collected urine at the clinic to members of the investigational staff, who measured the volume of the urine fractions. 10 ml of the urine was immediately transferred to the central laboratory facility of the University Hospitals (U.Z. Leuven) for analysis of urea and creatinine content. A 20 ml aliquot was stored at -20\u00b0C until further analyses. On the evening of day 20 or the morning of day 21, one stool was collected by each subject in a plastic recipient (round box with lid, 500 ml volume) dispensed to the subjects by members of the investigational team. The recipients with stool were stored immediately after collection at home at 4\u00b0C until delivery at the clinic. All stool samples were delivered to the clinic within 20 h of stool production. Upon delivery, 2.5 g of each stool sample was immediately fixed by members of the investigational staff in paraformaldehyde for microbial analysis by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and other aliquots of 2.0 g were stored at -20\u00b0C until further analyses of short chain fatty acids.\n\nAnalytical procedures\nMicrobiological analysis of faeces (delivered at the end of each of the 4 periods):\nStool samples were analysed to evaluate the influence of the consumption of different bread types on the composition of the faecal microbiota. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to count the number of different bacterial groups in paraformaldehyde fixed stool samples. For total bacterial cell counts, 4\u0092-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used. The probes used for group-specific FISH analysis were Bif164 for the Bifidobacterium sp. group, Lac158 for the Lactobacillus sp. group, Ec1531 for the Enterobacteriaceae and an equimolar mixture of Chis150 and Clit135 for the Clostridium histolyticum/lituseburense group. Rod-shaped bacteria fluorescing with the Lac158 probe were scored as Lactobacillus rods. Filters were mounted on clean microscope slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). Digital images of the slides, viewed with a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMRXA epifluorescence microscope, were taken with a Kodak Megaplus 1.4 charge-coupled device camera. These images were analysed and fluorescent cells were counted by using Quantimet HR600 image analysis software (Leica). Depending on the amount of fluorescent cells, 10 to 30 microscopic fields were counted. \n\nShort chain fatty acids in faeces (delivered at the end of each of the 4 periods):\nTo vials containing faecal samples (2 g) the following was added: 0.5 ml 9.2 M sulfuric acid, 0.4 ml of 0.75 % (v/v) 2-methylhexanoic acid (internal standard), 0.4 g NaCl and 2 ml diethyl ether. After shaking the vials for 2 minutes, the vials were centrifuged (3 min at 3000 x g) and the diethyl ether phase transferred to glass vials. The diethyl ether phase containing the organic acids was analysed on a gas-liquid chromatograph equipped with a EC-1000 Econo-Cap column (Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA; dimensions: 25 m x 0.53 mm, film thickness 1.2 \u00b5m; acid-modified polyethylene glycol as liquid phase) and a flame ionisation detector. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 ml per minute and the column temperature and injector temperature were set at 130 and 195\u00b0C, respectively. Concentrations of SCFAs were calculated based on standards with known concentrations of the different acids. The concentration of total SCFA was calculated as the sum of the concentrations of acetic, propionic and butyric acid.\n\np-Cresol and phenol in urine (delivered after 48 h collection at the end of each of the four periods):\nTotal p-cresol and phenol content in urinary samples was assayed by Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The pH of 950 \u00b5L urine was adjusted to 1.0 with 50 \u00b5L concentrated sulphuric acid (Merck KaA, Darmstadt, Germany). After addition of 50\u00b5L 2,6-dimethylphenol solution (20mg/100ml; Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) as internal standard, the solution was heated for 30min at 90\u00b0C to deproteinise and hydrolyse conjugated p-cresol and phenol. After cooling down, p-cresol and phenol were extracted in 1.0 ml ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany). The acetyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and finally 0.5 \u00b5L was analysed on a GC-MS (Trace GC-MS, Thermo-Finnigan, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA). The analytical column was a 30 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.50 \u00b5m RxiTM-5-MS (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium GC grade was used as a carrier gas with a constant flow of 1.3 ml/min. The oven was programmed from 55\u00b0C (isothermal for 5min), and increased by 10\u00b0C/min to 160\u00b0C and by 20\u00b0C/min to 280\u00b0C. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in electron impact full scan mode from m/z 59 to m/z 590 at 2 scans/s.\n\nRecording of stool parameters and gastrointestinal symptoms:\nGastrointestinal symptoms were monitored daily during the last week of every 3-week intake period. The volunteers were asked to daily grade the following symptoms: abdominal cramps, flatulence and bloating. The severity of the symptoms was graded on a 4-step scale ranging from no (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3) to severe (4) symptoms as described by van Munster et al. (1994). During the last week of every 3-week intake period, defecation frequency as well as consistency of the stool according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale were recorded daily through appropriate questionnaires. The average stool frequency was calculated as the number of stools divided by the number of days of diary recording, the average stool consistency as the sum of Bristol Stool Form Scales divided by the number of stools and the composite parameter of stool frequency and consistency (also called Bristol composite measure) as the sum of Bristol Stool Form Scales divided by the number of days of diary recording.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Applicable", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder21064-0", "contactId": "Contact59075_21064", "sponsorId": "Sponsor57665"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact59075_21064", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Kristin", "surname": "Verbeke", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (Targid) and Leuven Food Science and Nutrition Research Centre (LFoRCe)\nUniversity Hospital Gasthuisberg\nK.U.

Functional osteopathy appears to produce additional therapeutic mechanisms: somatic work appears to reactivate cell assemblies, useful when verbal reconstruction is difficult or impossible. Without verbal induction, recall occurs when psychic resistance lowers, protecting fragile victims from potential depressive or psychotic decompensation. The \u0093tactile dialogue\u0094 is respectful of the body\u0092s resistance and in this manner rapidly leads to a feeling of security, narcissistic reassurance and peaceful dissociation. These elements of the therapeutic context bring about recall of the traumatic information without anxiety, further eliminating avoidance strategies which maintain post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n3. Finally, myofascial tensions acquired from the accident (whiplash in particular) potentially contribute to neurovegetative disorders, to sensitisation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and to persistent pain. Eliminating these mechanical tensions relieves muscular skeletal pain, itself having the potential to produce catecholaminergic and glutamatergic disorders.\n4.

The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be humiliating or embarrassing.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "1. Assess general aspects of social anxiety: \n1.1. Patients complete the subscale of the social phobia and anxiety inventory (SPAI, Turner, Beidel, Dancu, & Stanley, 1989; Dutch validation by B\u00f6gels and Reith, 1999)\n1.2. The anxiety and avoidance of the social phobia subscales of the fear questionnaire (FQ, Marks & Mathews, 1979)\n1.3. The subscale social sensitivity and distrust of the symptom checklist (SCL-90, Dutch validation Arrindell & Ettema, 1986)\n1.4. The fear of negative evaluation scale (FNE-short, Leary, 1983)\n2. All these questionnaires possess satisfactory psychometric qualities.\n3. The level idiosyncratic social anxiety of the patients is composed out of the anxiety and avoidance ratings (scale 0-8) of participants' idiosyncratic main phobia (e.g., talking to unfamiliar people) of the FQ, a severity rating (scale 0-8) of the idiosyncratic target complaint that the participant formulates (e.g., feeling insecure) and avoidance and anxiety ratings on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of five constructed target situations (e.g., I say something to an unfamiliar person and I feel that I blush) \n4. These target situations are carefully formulated by the therapist and patient in two pre treatment sessions\n5. General psychopathology is measured with the SCL-90 subscales generalised anxiety, agoraphobia, depression, somatisation, obsessive-compulsivity, sleeping problems, and other problems, and the subscales agoraphobia and blood/Injury of the FQ\n6. The clinical significant change is determined with the ratings on the social phobia subscale of the SPAI. \n7. Patients scoring below 89 are considered social anxiety free and a score of 89 or higher represent still suffering from social anxiety \n8. This cut-off point was based on data of B\u00f6gels and Reith (1999) in which a score above 88 corresponded with 91% correct diagnoses of SAD", "secondaryOutcome": "1 .Patients\u0092 characteristics are assessed at pre-assessment: \n1.1.

Axis I and Axis II diagnoses are determined at pre-assessment with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders (SCID-I, First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &Williams, 1996; SCID II).\n3. The following attention measures are assessed: \n3.1. State self-focused attention is measured with the Self\u0096Focused Attention (SFA) scale (B\u00f6gels, Alberts, & De Jong, 1997), which consists of the subscales SFA on Arousal (item example: \u0093In the presence of other people, I\u0092m constantly focusing on ... whether my heart is beating\u0094) and SFA on Performance (item example: \u0093In the presence of other people, I\u0092m constantly focusing on ... how well I take part in the conversation\u0094)\n3.2. Factor-analysis confirmed the existence of two factors, as well as a reliable total score (B\u00f6gels et al., 1997). The subscales Public and Private Self-Consciousness of the Self Consciousness Scale (SCS, Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975, Dutch validation B\u00f6gels, Alberts, & de Jong, 1996) are administered to assess a dispositional tendency to be aware of oneself, privately or publicly\n4. Cognitions related to social anxiety are measured with:\n4.1. The Social Phobic Belief scale (SPB), a 15 item questionnaire measuring the conviction of negative beliefs related to social phobia, that is, negative assumptions about the self, the others, as well as conditional beliefs (B\u00f6gels, unpublished). The reliability and discriminant validity of the SPB has been demonstrated in previous research (e.g., Voncken, B\u00f6gels, & De Vries, 2004). \n4.2. The probability and cost ratings of the negative automatic thought (e.g. these people do not like me) that are part of the formulated target situations\n5. We measure the view of self, using the self subscale of the Self-Other-Ideal Questionnaire (Miskimins, Wilson, Nicolas-Braucht, & Berry, 1971). This questionnaire measures 15 aspects of functioning, which seem relevant to social anxiety, such as:\n5.1. Smart and skilled\n5.2. Physically attractive \n5.3. Friendly and warm \n6. Patients rate each item on a VAS in which 0 represents the most negative and 100 the most positive outcome.

We remove the parts about depression and rephrased them into SAD\n3. In session 6 and 7 task concentration training for SAD was added\n4. In session 5 and 6 patients practice in-session and in their daily life how to focus attention outward rather than inward (task-focused versus self-focused), first in more neutral social situations, and then using the list of 5 difficult social situations that they formulate before treatment, their idiosyncratic situations (see outcome measures)\n5. At the same time, they maintain daily mindfulness practice according to their own choice of combination of exercises learned (bodyscan, yoga, sitting meditation with awareness of the breath, body, sounds, thoughts). \n6.

Although this is a pilot study, it is recommended that individuals will be randomly allocated to prevent bias.

Following Local Research Ethics Committee approval, all patients meeting the study inclusion criteria will be invited to take part.  Patients will be stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status to balance randomisation, so that each group is representative of the population being studied. The procedure protocol is well established and will be adhered to in both groups. Institutional limitations dictate that randomisation will be done using sealed envelopes, rather than computer generated. This will be done independently by the MRC statistician within the  Research & Development Department at Papworth Hospital. Investigators will be required to telephone the department to obtain the randomisation group and study number, once the patient has signed the informed consent.\n\nThis study will compare outcomes when the procedure of talc pleurodesis is performed by a core group of senior nursing staff, compared to medical staff. The same procedure protocol will be adhered to by both groups. Both doctors and nurses will be taught how to perform the procedure by a Consultant in Chest Medicine, or a Senior Specialist Registrar identified by the Consultant as someone who is skilled and competent in performing talc pleurodesis. An educational package has been designed by the chief investigator, in collaboration with Consultant medical staff, to assist the individuals performing the procedure with self-directed learning. Evidence will be required to demonstrate their understanding of the indications and contra-indications for talc pleurodesis, as well as recognition of complications post-procedure and actions required.  \n\nThe assessment of the most suitable time to perform the procedure, with regard to drainage of effusion and radiographic appearance will be decided by the medical team responsible for the care of the patient.
