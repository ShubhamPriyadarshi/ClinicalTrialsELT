The control group received standard care. \n\nAt the first 45-minute visit, patients received a specific diagnosis, reassurance that no serious disease was present, instructions on self-management, instructions on taking medications on a fixed schedule, and information on indications for return to work before complete symptom remission. Return to work was negotiated with patients and was never forced on them. Instructions on self-management included instructions to avoid bed rest, instructions to promote early mobilization of the painful regions, restrictions on the use of splint and neck collars, training in stretching and strengthening exercises, teaching of ergonomic care, delivery of booklets in instances of back or neck pain, and information on optimal levels of physical activity. Patients with higher degrees of disability or abnormal pain behavior received immediate extra reassurance, information on pain-relieving positions, and a telephone call or second visit within 72 hours.\n\nSpecific protocols were created for low-back, neck, shoulder, arm and hand, knee, and foot pain and included the three-level clinical-management system described below. Moving a patient from the lower to the upper levels of the system implied the need for further diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and was indicated 1) after a patient spent a predefined period at the lower level without return to work or substantial clinical improvement or 2) by the clinical judgment of the rheumatologist.\n\nAt the first level of the system, patients received the clinical management started at the first visit, including a diagnosis based on clinical criteria, pharmacologic treatment of pain and inflammation, pharmacologic treatment of anxiety and depression, peripheral intra- and periarticular injections, and education. Time spent at the first level averaged 2 to 6 weeks. At the second level, patients received maintenance of therapy plus referral for formal rehabilitation and laboratory tests, radiography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography.

In fact, evidence suggests that inadequate reporting is associated with biased treatment effect estimates. Quality assessment is often achieved by use of checklists or scales. In the field of Non Pharmacological Treatment (NPT), a checklist - the checklist to evaluate a report of a nonpharmacological trial (CLEAR NPT) - was developed to assess the quality of RCTs included in meta-analysis. However, reproducibility issues have been raised because these checklists use items inconsistently defined and not well understood by reviewers such as blinding, dropout and withdrawals or an intention-to-treat analysis.

Concerns have been raised that some patients may be receiving inappropriately high doses of inhaled steroids. The aims of this study are to assess the clinical and economic implications of stepping down inhaled steroid treatment over a one year period on patients with chronic stable asthma receiving more than 1000 mcg inhaled steroid daily.\n\nThe primary objectives are:\n1. To compare the number of exacerbations of asthma in the group in whom the dose of inhaled steroid is reduced by up to 50% with those in whom the dose is unaltered over a one year period;\n2. To perform an economic evaluation of the two management plans.
