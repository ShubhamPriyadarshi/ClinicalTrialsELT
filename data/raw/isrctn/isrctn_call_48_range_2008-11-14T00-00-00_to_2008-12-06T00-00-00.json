The screen showed a moving point in the middle of a target and the participants were asked to follow the target through shifting their weight. All participants received an exercise protocol in which the exercises gradually became more complex. \n\nThe IF group participants were, prior to IF trials, instructed with the feedback that the moving point on the feedback screen represented their body centre of gravity. They were instructed to focus on this centre through concentrating on their belly (while looking straight ahead at the video screen) and to volitionally move this point on the screen through exertion of force on this imaginary point. \n\nThe EF group participants were instructed that the moving point on the feedback screen represented an air bubble in a level, (as used in the building industry to determine a level horizontal line), positioned in front of the feet of the participant standing on the plate. Such a level was attached to the platform with an electronic cable, thus suggesting a direct connection between movements of the air bubble in the level and the marker on the screen. The EF participants had to focus on the air bubble (while looking straight ahead at the video screen) and try to consciously move this bubble in the level. \n\nAll participants were expected to perform at least three practice trials per exercise on two week days for five consecutive weeks under the treatment conditions. Before every practice trial, participants were given short reminders to focus on the respective 'moving points'. In a fourth trial, the time needed to perform the exercise under test conditions was measured together with the Dynamic Stability Index of the participants. This procedure was chosen to rule out short-term learning effects. Training duration lasted between 25 and 35 minutes. \n\nIn order to avoid bias, the information that focus of attention of the participants possibly plays an important role in the speed of learning was not disclosed before training commenced.

Previous spinal surgery will have caused adhesions in the patients' vertebrae, making the approach and the application of the epidural injection much more difficult. Chances of complications are a lot higher and the risk of needle misplacing increases. \n4. Complaints arising after trauma. Patients who developed lumbosacral radicular syndrome as a result of trauma may have pathology that needs additional diagnostic imaging and treatment other than injections. \n5. Maintenance therapy of oral corticosteroids. Apart from possible interference with the study results, patients on maintenance therapy of oral corticosteroids have a higher risk that their symptoms may be caused by osteoporosis which may need additional diagnostic imaging. \n6. Oral anticoagulant therapy or bleeding disorders. Treatment with acenocoumarol and/or other anticoagulants increases the risk of bleeding. Since this risk is not as high with platelet aggregation inhibitors, we will not exclude patients on acetylsalicyclic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) maintenance therapy. \n7.

Morbid obesity: body mass index (BMI) (weight/square length) greater than 35 In these patients, back pain complaints are much more likely to have other causes than lumbosacral radicular syndrome.

NIV during sleep improves oxygenation and transcutaneous CO2 overnight, together with an improvement in sleep quality and daytime arterial blood gas tensions. It has been postulated that either control of nocturnal hypoventilation with resetting of central drive, or the relief of chronic respiratory muscle fatigue is the crucial factor determining success. Some studies have shown that the improvement in daytime arterial blood gas tensions relates to a resetting of the central respiratory controller, but not to changes in respiratory muscle function. However Schoenhofer showed that NIV used for 8 hours per day during wakefulness was just as effective at improving arterial blood gas tensions as 8 hours per day during sleep. There was a significant improvement in respiratory muscle strength, without any change in central respiratory drive, and they postulated that NIV \"works\" by improving respiratory muscle function. \nThis distinction is important since the mechanism by which NIV \"works\" should determine the treatment endpoint, i.e. abolition of respiratory muscle activity to achieve complete muscle rest or improved sleep efficiency and optimisation of blood gas tensions overnight to restore central respiratory drive and improve sleep quality, with consequent beneficial effects upon daytime function. In turn this may affect the choice of ventilator that is to be used; for instance pressure support ventilation (PSV), in which the ventilator is triggered into inspiration and expiration according to patient effort, results in less complete muscle rest but may be more comfortable than full pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), during which the patient is required to make no respiratory effort. However, the cost of achieving complete muscle rest may be higher inflation pressures and an imposed pattern of breathing, which patients may find uncomfortable, and that compromises sleep quality. \nWe plan a comparison of pressure support ventilation against volume cycled ventilation in a one month randomised crossover trial to identify the relative importance of respiratory muscle fatigue and central respiratory drive in chronic respiratory failure. This will help to identify treatment endpoints in establishing patients on home non-invasive ventilation.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Arterial blood gas tensions (pO2, PCO2)", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

This is a widespread form of treatment. The success rate reported in a number of studies is little better than chance. Intensive research in the last 5 years has indicated the mechanisms of failure of this treatment, and potential ways to avoid it. Too often infection remains inside the tooth. Treatment techniques have been modified to clean the tooth better and to reduce communication between the inside of the tooth and the body tissues. There is a need to investigate the success rate of the modified procedure in patients to see if it fulfils the initial results of the laboratory research.\nIt is planned to recruit patients who require apicectomy according to specific criteria of indication. A total of 320 patients will be randomly allocated to two groups; the control group will have root-end resection with minimal bevelling followed by ultrasonic cavity preparation, and then filling with what is now the current material, IRM; the experimental group will have similar treatment except that the filling material will be the newly developed Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA).

Currently it is widespread practice in most obstetric units in the United Kingdom to induce labour 14 days after the estimated date of delivery (EDD). While this has been shown to have a beneficial effect on perinatal outcome, it may cause consumer dissatisfaction as it is perceived to be a painful intervention in an otherwise normal pregnancy. Measurement of the biparietal diameter at 20 weeks gestation has been shown to improve the accuracy of gestational age assessment, and this should lead to a reduction in rates of induction of labour for postdates. Gestational age assessment using CRL in the 1st trimester is more accurate than the biparietal diameter and may further reduce the numbers requiring induction for postdates. There is an increasing shift to perform prenatal diagnosis in the first trimester. Those providing antenatal care may have to choose the best time at which a routine scan in pregnancy can be offered. If a first trimester ultrasound scan is shown to improve the customisation and therefore the appropriateness of obstetric care this would provide further evidence to justify its introduction as well as its use in screening for Down's syndrome, either with nuchal fold or as an adjunct to serum screening.\nThe objective is to determine whether an ultrasound scan in the first trimester of pregnancy will lead to more accurate assessment of gestational age and consequently lead to a reduction in the number of pregnancies induced at term and fourteen days. If this is the case then there will be cost savings for the NHS, as well as the reduction in unnecessary and potentially painful interventions.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Rates of induction of labour for postdates", "secondaryOutcome": "1.
