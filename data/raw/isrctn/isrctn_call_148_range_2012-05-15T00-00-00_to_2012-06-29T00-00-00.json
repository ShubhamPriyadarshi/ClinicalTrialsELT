Equally, failures to perform sufficiently in these skills have been identified as root causes in over 60% of major surgical complications. Crew Resource Management (CRM) - training was originally developed by the aviation industry to enhance non-technical skills of flight crews in order to improve flight safety. CRM training has subsequently also been used to train teams in high-risk areas of healthcare such as emergency medicine and anesthesia,and more recently, surgical teams with positive effects on team performance and safety culture. Although non-technical skills are thought to be essential for safe and efficient team performance in the operating room, these skills are not routinely taught in structured curricula in surgical residency programs in Canada. \nThe aim of this study is to validate a comprehensive CRM-curriculum to teach non-technical skills to surgical residents early on in their residency training in order to shorten the learning curve and move the acquisition of these skills out of the operating room.\n\nWho can participate? \nAll surgical residents in the University of Toronto residency program that begin PGY1 training in July 2012.\n\nWhat does the study involve? \nThe CRM-curriculum will be validated in this study involving three study arms, each comprising 12 surgical residents from the University of Toronto Surgical Residency Program. The study group, consisting of residents in the first postgraduate year (PGY1), will receive structured training in non-technical skills through didactic courses, video material, high-fidelity simulation, and web-based e-learning modules for home study. The control group (PGY1) will receive conventional residency training. A comparison group of senior residents (PGY5) will be evaluated to demonstrate the degree of natural non-technical skills acquisition, i.e. learning on the job. The study and control groups will be evaluated for non-technical skills and performance in a simulated crisis scenario at baseline and after the training period, and re-evaluated at 1 year to test for skill retention. The comparison group will only be evaluated once regarding performance in a simulated crisis scenario.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nParticipation in the study may be beneficial for the study group since they will acquire valuable skills that are likely to improve their performance in the operating room, in particular increasing their preparedness and performance in a crisis situation. The control group will be offered to also receive the training at the end oft he study period. There are no known risks associated with participation in the study.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nAllan Waters Family Simulation Centre and Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, at 209 Victoria Street, Toronto, Ontario.\n\nWhen is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? \nThe study is expected to begin in July 2012 and end in August 2013.\n\nWho is funding the study?\nSt. Michael's Hospital (Canada)  \n\nWho is the main contact? \nDr. Nicolas Dedy \ndedyn@smh.ca", "primaryOutcome": "Performance in standardized, simulated crisis scenarios with regard to non-technical skills [Oxford Non-technical skills (NOTECHS) and Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) rating scales]", "secondaryOutcome": "1.

One intriguing finding is that when people drink a drink which has a high energy content, they don\u0092t feel full and eat less afterwards.  In contrast, if they have the same energy as a bowl of soup, they are able to adjust the amount they eat later quite accurately.  The aim of this study is to try and find out why this is.\n\nWho can participate? \nAs this study is not aiming to help specific patient groups, potential participants are normal members of the public who are healthy.  As the study does require people to eat foods and drinks, you should not take part if you are diabetic, are taking prescription medications, smoke more than 5 cigarettes a day or have a diagnosed eating problem.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nIf you took part, you would come to our test centre on 7 different days.  Day 1 would be a screening and familiarization day, and the subsequent 6 days would be the test sessions.  On each of these days you would be required to eat nothing and to drink only water from 11pm on the previous night, and would first come for a simple breakfast between 8am and 10am.  You would then come back 3 hours later and would be asked to consume a test drink (in the form of a fruit-juice/yoghurt drink) and then 30 minutes later would be served a lunch of pasta followed by ice-cream.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating? \nAs the study involves eating foods and drinks made from regular ingredients, the only risks are to people who suffer from diabetes to who have an allergy to any of the ingredients.  We will screen all volunteers and if you have diabetes or food allergies you would not be allowed to participate.\n\nWhere is the study run from? \nUniversity of Sussex. \n\nWhen does the study taking place?\nThe study took place between March 2010 and August 2010.\n\nWho is funding the project?\nThe project is funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).\n\nWho is the main contact?\nProfessor Martin Yeomans\nmartin@sussex.ac.uk", "primaryOutcome": "1.

A trained SFH project worker will visit each school and take Years 5 and 6 children (on two separate occasions) through a series of educational activities using a SFH toolkit. Children from the same year are grouped together for the SFH session. Children, whose parents specifically ask for their children to be withdrawn from the SFH activities, will continue to attend their regular classes or appropriate provision will be made.\n\nThe SFH activities consist of a class-room presentation, quiz, games, role play, posters and a speech bubble competition lasting approximately one and a half hours. Children will be given a promise form which contains pictorial and written messages on the hazards of SHS, a pictorial step-guide for families to make their homes smoke free, a puzzle to help families learn about the benefits of a smoke free home and a tear-off slip to make a commitment to impose smoking restrictions at home. Children are expected to bring this slip back to school and receive a SFH Gold certificate should their home be totally smoke free. These activities are designed to raise awareness among children about the hazards of SHS and empower them to negotiate smoking restrictions with other family members at home. Families are encouraged to \"sign-up\" to a voluntary contract not to allow smoking inside their houses and in front of children. In addition:\n1. School teachers will receive a training session on SFH to help them in reinforcing SFH messages\n2. A brief session on SFH for all children will be provided through a whole school assembly, and\n3.

Heart rate during CCR, measured continuously by using a commercial heart rate monitor (Polar, Oy, Finland)\n3. Blood lactate levels (mmol/L), measured with capillary blood samples taken at baseline and after 5, 10 and 15 minutes and using an automated lactate analyser", "secondaryOutcome": "1. Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. All subjects performed a maximal cardiopulmonary bicycle exercise test, designed to reach peak oxygen uptake capacity (VO2peak) within 8 - 12 minutes, as executed in previous studies from our laboratory. During the cycling test, an electronically braked Ergo 1500 cycle (ErgoFit, Pirmasens, Germany) was used. The cycling frequency was set at 70 cycles/min and the test was ended when the subject failed to maintain a cycling frequency of at least 60 cycles/min. Both the starting and incremental cycling resistance was set between 30 and 45 Watts, depending on age, height, weight, and gender. The cycling resistance increased every single minute. Before every test, a gas and volume calibration was done automatically. During the tests, environmental temperature was kept stable (20\u00b0C). During the exercise tests, pulmonary gas exchange analysis was performed by a cardiopulmonary ergospirometry device (Schiller CS200, Schiller AG, Switzerland). Oxygen uptake capacity (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) were collected breath-by-breath and averaged every 10 seconds. By plotting exercise VO2 against exercise VCO2, ventilatory threshold was calculated by V-slope method, as executed in previous studies from our laboratory. A software programme of the ergospirometry device determined the break point of the two slopes. Maximal cycling power output (Wpeak) was reported.\n2. Muscle strength. Muscle strength measurements of the upper body were performed using a standardised strength testing protocol on an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex). Following a 5-minute standardised warming-up (Technogym Lat Pull, Pectoral, ArmCurl), subjects were positioned and fixated in a semi supine (15\u00b0 backward inclination) sitting position (shoulder and thorax fixation). The rotational axis of the dynamometer was aligned with the transverse shoulder/elbow-joint axis and strapped to the distal end of the humerus/radius-ulna. The alignment of the dynamometer was systematically controlled using anatomical reference points. To test upper body strength each subject performed two maximal isometric shoulder flexions, extensions, adductions, abductions, internal and external rotations as well as elbow flexion and extensions (3 seconds) at respective shoulder/elbow angels of 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 interspersed by 45-second rest intervals. Maximal isometric torque at each angle was calculated as the average of the manually smoothed static torque curves. After a brief rest period upper body muscle fatigue was tested. Subjects performed one bout of 20 maximal isokinetic (180\u00b0/S) shoulder flexions, extensions, adductions, abductions, internal and external rotations and elbow flexions and extensions from 90\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 (ROM of 70\u00b0). After each contraction the upper/lower arm was returned passively to the 90\u00b0 point. Muscle fatigue was calculated as the percentage total work decrease from the first three contractions to the last three. All tests were performed unilaterally. Immediately after the muscle strength measurements, the same examiner would ask subjects to perform dominant hand dynamometry (Jamar handgrip dynamometer; Sammons Preston Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL) two times.

Cognitive therapy allows an individualised approach within clear boundaries, and incorporates a process of assessment and formulation, which is manualised. The specific interventions are dependent on the individual formulation, but the range of permissible interventions is described in our published manual. Fidelity to the treatment protocol will be ensured by regular supervision of the therapists and assessed by rating tape recordings of sessions using a revised version of the Cognitive Therapy Scale (Dobson, Shaw, & Vallis, 1985). This is a widely-accepted approach to the standardisation of CT, which we have adopted in previous large-scale trials. Participants will receive up to 25 weekly one-hour sessions plus up to four booster sessions. \n\nControl group:\nThe control condition is treatment as usual plus monitoring, which represents an enhancement over routine care since psychotic symptoms will be detected earlier than in usual practice and appropriate treatment referrals made (the reduction of duration of untreated psychosis is a national target for the NHS, and our control condition will achieve this). Monitoring will identify untreated psychosis and any risks to self or others that require immediate action. In addition, the monitoring group will also receive two standardised components of care: ensuring that the patient has a General Practitioner and encouraging regular contact with them (since several of our pilot study patients did not have a GP at intake); and development of a crisis card providing contact details for appropriate local sources of help in a psychiatric emergency. Monitoring will not include liaison with a clinical team, should one be involved, except where risk issues necessitate this. The use of enhanced standard care as a control has the advantages of (i) controlling at least in part for non-specific contact and (ii) ensuring that all trial participants derive some benefit from the trial (this expected benefit was included in the power calculations), therefore ensuring that it conforms to the highest ethical standards. \n\nAll participants will be monitored by a monthly assessment for the first six months and then every three months for up to two years total.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Not Specified", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": "2012 Results article in http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491790 results", "publicationStage": "Results", "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": {"output": {"@id": "3bbc41ec-8226-4868-b669-e3133dd7d4d6", "@outputType": "resultsarticle", "@artefactType": "ExternalLink", "@dateCreated": "2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "@dateUploaded": "", "@peerReviewed": "true", "@patientFacing": "false", "@createdBy": "Data migration", "externalLink": {"@url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491790"}, "description": "results", "productionNotes": null}}, "parties": {"funderId": ["Funder17568-0", "Funder17568-1"], "contactId": "Contact55530_17568", "sponsorId": "Sponsor54114"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact55530_17568", "title": "Prof", "forename": "Anthony", "surname": "Morrison", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "School of Psychological Sciences\nUniversity of Manchester\nOxford Road", "city": "Manchester", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "M13 9PL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected"}, "sponsor": {"@id": "Sponsor54114", "organisation": "University of Manchester (UK)", "website": "http://www.manchester.ac.uk/", "sponsorType": "University/education", "contactDetails": {"address": "c/o Dr Karen Shaw\nResearch Office\nChristie Building\nUniversity of Manchester\nOxford Road", "city": "Manchester", "state": "England", "country": "United Kingdom", "zip": "M13 9PL", "telephone": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}, "email": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions"}}, "privacy": "Protected", "gridId": "grid.5379.8", "rorId": "https://ror.org/027m9bs27"}, "funder": [{"@id": "Funder17568-0", "name": "Medical Research Council (G0500264) (UK)", "fundRef": "http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265"}, {"@id": "Funder17568-1", "name": "Department of Health (UK)", "fundRef": null}]}, {"trial": {"@lastUpdated": "2012-05-22T00:00:00.000Z", "@version": "25", "isrctn": {"@dateAssigned": "2008-06-12T00:00:00.000Z", "#text": "88750971"}, "trialDescription": {"@thirdPartyFilesAcknowledgement": "false", "acknowledgment": "true", "title": "PILA trial: Levofloxacin vs piperacillin/sulbactam and sultamicillin in patients with acute cholecystitis", "scientificTitle": null, "acronym": "PILA", "studyHypothesis": "In patients with acute cholecystitis the use of broad spectrum penicillin is generally accepted.

A total of 66 untreated patients with MDD will be recruited. Under single-blind condition, patients will be randomly assigned to paroxetine (PRX) combined with active or sham electroacupuncture (EA) for six weeks. PRX dose is initiated at 10 mg/day and escalated to maximum 40 mg/day within one week. EA intervention is conducted by electrically stimulating two acupoints: Yin-Tang (EX-HN3) and Bai-Hui (DU-20) for 45 minutes daily. \n\nBoth groups of the patients will receive orally administered PRX for six weeks. The dose is initiated at 10 mg/day and escalated to maximum 40 mg/day within one week. The choice of PRX, but not other SSRIs, is because the slow onset of PRX action has been well demonstrated in our preliminary and previous studies. Treatments with the dose range defined have been reported to yield optimal clinical outcomes in Chinese depressed patients. Concomitant use of other psychoactive medications is not allowed. If significantly clinical conditions have to require such medications, patients will be asked to withdraw from the study. Patients who have poor compliance with medication schedules (below 80%) will also be removed from the study. \n\nMeanwhile, active or sham EA intervention is conducted daily for six weeks. For active EA, a pair of stainless steel needles of 0.25 mm diameter are inserted at a depth of 10 - 20 mm obliquely into Bai-Hui (Du-20) and Yin-Tang (EX-HN3), through which electric stimulation with continuous waves with 2 Hz at 6 voltages are delivered. The intensities of stimulation are adjusted to a level at which patients feel most comfortable. To ensure the active procedure as identical as the sham procedure, the inserted needles are affixed with adhesive tapes. For the sham treatment, the needles are inserted into two non-traditionally defined points at 1 - 1.5 cm around the acupoints used for active EA, but immediately taken out and put back into plastic needle guiding tubes. The needles contained in the tubes are then affixed on the point skins with adhesive tapes and stimulated electrically as described above.

These symptoms are mainly vague in nature. The most common symptoms were: increased abdominal size, abdominal bloating, fatigue, abdominal pain, indigestion and urinary frequency. Women also complain of delay in diagnosis due to factors such as incorrect initial diagnosis, initial referral to the wrong specialist, omission of a pelvic examination at the first visit, and not receiving an early ultrasound or CA125 test.
