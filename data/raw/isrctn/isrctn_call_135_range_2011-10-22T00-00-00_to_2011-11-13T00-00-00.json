All the improvisations created in the therapy sessions will be recorded either as MIDI-data (mallet midi-controllers and midi-percussion) or as digital audio (Djembe drums). For the analysis of MIDI-data, a computational method called MTTB (Music Therapy Toolbox), particularly developed for analysis of music therapy improvisations in MIDI-format will be employed. The MTTB-method makes possible to automatically extract various musical features as well as some aspects of therapist-client interaction. Previously the method has been successfully utilised in the study based on the analysis of clinical improvisations by people with mental retardation. For the analysis of digital audio data, a computational method called MIR (Music Information Retrieval) will be employed. Like the MTTB, the MIR also makes possible to extract particular musical features from the music and musical interaction to be further interpreted. The method has not been utilised in clinical context before. \n6. Collected video material is used as a resource for the interpretation of results, and for studying the processes. Master students and post-graduate students will conduct qualitative and quantitative content analyses. Focused microanalysis will be used for specific process-related issues and for studying emotional transitions during the micro- and macro-level processes.\n7. EEG measurement is applied based on the findings of earlier research on depression. Because of it\u0092s timelocked correlations it has been found to be the measure of choice for music and brain research, instead of using imaging techniques that provide distinct spatial information (such as fMRI and PET) but lack on time and event-related correlation. Depression is found to be correlated with a hypoactivation of left brain activity and this may be attenuated after treatment. Secondly, a more distinct and variable spectral EEG pattern according to personality and specific reactions of theta variables in the treatment and control group are expected as mediators of change. EEG research recordings (pre-test directly after inclusion/before randomisation, post-test three months after randomisation) and its corresponding patient data of the clinical groups will be monitored by a clinical neurologist. Analysis of the EEG will focus on topographic distribution of spectral power and percentage of EEG frequencies. All subjects will listen to two sets of stimuli:\n7.1. A randomised order of  short pieces of instrumental music, excerpts of film sound tracks previously rated and categorised according to the emotional dimensions valence, tension and energy\n7.2. An ordered set of short pieces of instrumental music according to five basic emotions (tender, anger, fear, sad, happy)\n8. An evaluation of emotional qualities of music will be processed (pre-test directly after inclusion/before randomisation, post-test three months after randomisation and follow-up test 6 months after randomisation). In these behavioural experiments participants will listen two sets of music excerpts and self-rate those based on emotional qualities and characteristics of music. The first set of excerpts has been chosen based on basic emotions. The second set is based on the three-dimensional model of musical emotions. All stimulus examples have been tested and validated with non-clinical population. In experiment participants will listen excerpts in randomised order and self-rating those by using computer based self-rating patches. \n\nAll outcomes are measured before and three months after randomisation.", "trialWebsite": null, "ethicsApprovalRequired": "Old ethics approval format", "ethicsCommittees": null, "ethicsApproval": "Ethics approval received from the Keski-Suomen sairaanhoitopiiri (Central Finland Health Care District) Eettinen toimikunta (Ethical Board) on the 24th October 2007 (ref: Poytakirja 9/2007)."}, "externalRefs": {"doi": "10.1186/ISRCTN84185937", "eudraCTNumber": null, "irasNumber": null, "clinicalTrialsGovNumber": null, "protocolSerialNumber": "N/A"}, "trialDesign": {"studyDesign": "The study will be a single-blinded randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms", "primaryStudyDesign": "Interventional", "secondaryStudyDesign": "Randomised controlled trial", "trialSettings": {"trialSetting": "Hospital"}, "trialTypes": {"trialType": "Treatment"}, "overallStatusOverride": null, "reasonAbandoned": null, "overallStartDate": "2008-03-10T00:00:00.000Z", "overallEndDate": "2009-06-30T00:00:00.000Z"}, "participants": {"recruitmentCountries": {"country": "Finland"}, "trialCentres": {"trialCentre": {"@id": "ac680c44-9541-4056-b3b9-f55d360df41b", "name": "Department of Music", "address": null, "city": "Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "state": null, "country": "Finland", "zip": "41520"}}, "participantTypes": {"participantType": "Patient"}, "inclusion": "1.
