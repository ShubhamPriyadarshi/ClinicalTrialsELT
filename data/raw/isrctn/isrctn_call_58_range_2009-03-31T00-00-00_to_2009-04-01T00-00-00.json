Percutaneous subclavian\n2. Internal jugular\n3.

Generator of the assignment was separated from the executor; randomisation was intra-operatively carried out by the data manager of the trial using a computer-assisted procedure and communicated to the operators. Devices were implanted under local anaesthesia in an operating room or in an angiographic suite, using maximal sterile barrier precautions. A confirmatory chest X-ray was always obtained after the placement. Data from the implantation and follow-up of these patients were entered into a software registry and analysed by epidemiologists-biostatisticians. \n\nA follow-up continued on an outpatient basis at regular intervals of 15 - 21 days until the device was removed, the patient died or the study was closed (30th June 2007). The planned minimum follow-up period was 6 months for each patient. Power and color Doppler ultrasonography of internal jugular and subclavian veins was carried out at regular intervals (1 and 4 months after implant) or anytime when clinically suggested by the appearance of arm or facial swelling and/or pain. Patients with positive or dubious ultrasound (US) scans underwent a neck-chest computerised tomography scan, with i.v. contrast medium administration. Implanted ports have been flushed with 20 ml of normal saline and then filled with sterile heparinised saline after each infusion of medication or blood withdrawal (5 ml of a solution containing 50 IU/ml). If the port remained unused for long periods of time, the heparin lock was changed once every 28 days. Complications were recorded according to the timing of occurrence: early (intra-operative and post-implantation period to first use) and late complications (occurring after the first chemotherapy course given through the device). Patients who died within 6 months were retained in the analysis and were recorded as having no late complications unless one was noted before death.", "interventionType": "Other", "pharmaceuticalStudyTypes": null, "phase": "Phase III", "drugNames": null}}, "results": {"publicationPlan": "Not provided at time of registration", "ipdSharingStatement": null, "dataPolicies": {"dataPolicy": "Not provided at time of registration"}, "publicationDetails": null, "publicationStage": null, "biomedRelated": "false", "basicReport": null, "plainEnglishReport": null}, "outputs": null, "parties": {"funderId": "Funder18589-0", "contactId": "Contact56580_18589", "sponsorId": "Sponsor55154"}, "miscellaneous": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "ipdSharingPlan": "No"}, "attachedFiles": null}, "contact": {"@id": "Contact56580_18589", "title": "Dr", "forename": "Roberto", "surname": "Biffi", "orcid": null, "contactTypes": {"@xmlns:ssb": "http://www.67bricks.com/isrctn/functions", "contactType": "Scientific"}, "contactDetails": {"address": "via G.
