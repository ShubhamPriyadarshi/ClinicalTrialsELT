The spray is applied to the glans penis a short time prior to intercourse.\n\nMost studies evaluating treatments for PE include intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) in the definition of PE. It has been estimated that PE affects 30 - 40% of the male population, but is paradoxically a condition for which they are least likely to seek help.\n\nMen with PE exhibit abnormal autonomic reflex pathways for the ejaculatory process. These include lower vibratory threshold to ejaculation, shorter bulbocavernous latency time and higher bulbocavernous evoked potentials. Reducing the heightened sensitivity of the glans penis with topical anaesthetics might therefore be a way of improving IELT, without adversely affecting the sensation of ejaculation. \n\nAlthough IELT is an objective measure of ejaculatory function it does not address the impact of therapy on patients\u0092 well being and confidence in their sexual performance, which are important markers of treatment benefit. Therefore, if IELT is used as a sole efficacy measure it may not fully characterise the treatment benefit to the patient. For this reason, a patient reported outcome (PRO) known as the Index of Premature Ejaculation (IPE) will be used in this study in conjunction with IELT to evaluate efficacy. Thus the combination of the objective measure of ejaculatory latency with the PRO of IPE should be able to provide efficacy data which are representative of clinical benefit to the patient.\n\nThe use of lidocaine, prilocaine and eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA\u00c2\u00ae) cream as topical anaesthetics is well established. Many years of experience of use in large numbers of patients, as well as comprehensive non-clinical safety testing programs for various formulations of lidocaine and prilocaine exist, to support their safety and tolerability. This information, together with the clinical data from three studies with PSD502 (ANAE-059-00, PSD502-PE-001, and PSD502-PE-003), suggest that PSD502 may have beneficial effects in reducing penile sensation and prolonging IELT, and its use is unlikely to be associated with significant clinical safety or tolerability concerns.\n\nThe aim of this study is to provide additional placebo-controlled efficacy data to establish the clinical utility of PSD502 in the treatment of PE. In addition, long term open-label efficacy and safety data will be collected, to further support the registration package for PSD502 in the indication of treatment of PE.\n\nAs of 29/01/2010, this record was updated; all amendments can be found under the relevant section with the above update date.
