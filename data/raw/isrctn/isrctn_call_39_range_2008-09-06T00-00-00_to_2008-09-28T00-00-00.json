The control gel had the same formulation except for the LS extract. \n\nTwenty-six healthy volunteers (13 female and 13 male aged 19 to 25 years) were enrolled in this randomised, double-blind, cross-over study. The trial consisted of a pre-experimental phase and 2 experimental phases of 21 days each with a 1-month washout interval between them. To standardise the groups, the participants were submitted to a meticulous evaluation (pre-experimental phase) to score the plaque index (PLI), gingival index (GI) and the bleeding index (BI) of each tooth. All teeth of each subject were polished and flossed by the examiner to eliminate dental plaque remnants. The importance of oral hygiene was strongly reinforced. \n\nThirty days after the initial phase, the participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups (experimental phase).

The changes in the acceptable mismatch antigens will be analysed after each IVIG treatment course and the then extended profile of acceptable mismatches will be adjusted in the AM program.

All recipients will be given acetaminophen (1000 mg) and Di-adresoneF (25 mg), tavegil (2 mg), 30 minutes before the infusion.\n\nIn vivo administration of IVIG:\nIntravenous administration of IVIG (IVIG-L, Nanogam, Sanquin) in a dose of 2 g/kg with a maximum of 140 gram, in a dilute, low-osmolaric solution.

To avoid the risk of over-hydration in dialysis patients, IVIG-L has to be given during dialysis in a 4-hour period and if necessary continued thereafter (dependent on the total dose which has to be infused), or otherwise IVIG-L infusion can be started on a not-dialysis day (dependent on the cardiovascular status of the patient and under clinical surveillance) followed by dialysis thereafter.

If the patient who has completed the full desensitising treatment course has to wait longer than 4 weeks on the AM list in order to find a cross match negative organ, then another IVIG-L dose should be administered.

A clinical consequence of hyperkalaemia is hyperpolarisation block of neuromuscular cells, which starts with asthaenia, muscular pain and constipation. The most worrying clinical outcome is at cardiac level which can induce severe hypokinetic arrhythmias up to total atrio-ventricular block bundle. Severe hyperkalaemia leads to a potassium transfer, mediated by sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na/K-ATP-ase) pump, towards the intracellular space, thus increasing the concentration at this site. The task of dialysis treatment is to remove the extra amount of potassium in the interdialytic period due to the exogenous intake induced by vegetables, fruits, and their juices. The amount of potassium removed by dialysis is related to the concentration gradient between the serum potassium level and the potassium content of the dialysis bath.

Persons will be instructed to try to carry out a minimum of 15 minutes of exercise per day. Each task is designed to be carried out for a minute with a one minute rest between exercises. Brisk walking will be recommended to complete the 15 minute time recommendation. Progression will be to more difficult tasks and then by adding weights or repetitions. The aim is to build up to one-half hour of exercise per day including walking.  \n\nGroup 2 is assigned to The Home Cycling Program: Participants will be given a time and intensity graded program at an intensity that is comfortable and tolerable for the individual. The individual will be encouraged to augment, gradually, either the time of cycling per day or the work of cycling, always keeping within the limits of comfort and tolerability.

For optometric interventions that are prescribed for symptomatic relief, clinical tests of visual acuity (VA) often do not indicate significant improvement with the intervention.   \n\nVisual problems which cause symptoms but do not impair static VA might affect performance on dynamic tasks. Refractive errors and heterophoria are best described as continuous variables and the decision as to when to prescribe an intervention is based on clinical signs whose sensitivity and specificity for detecting symptoms is often, at best, under researched.\n\nThe objectively validated Wilkins Rate Of Reading Test will be used to assess the benefit of interventions.  This test uses simple words and is relatively independent of reading skill and does not assess linguistic or semantic factors.  The results are very dependent on dynamic visual skills and require sustained binocular single vision and clear vision.\n\nThe aims of the research \n1. In conditions where optical corrections may be prescribed but not improve VA (e.g. decompensated heterophoria): to investigate whether optical corrections influence performance at the Wilkins Rate of Reading test.\n\n2. In conditions where optical corrections may be prescribed and  improve VA (e.g. astigmatism): to investigate whether optical corrections influence performance at the Wilkins Rate of Reading test.\n\n3. In both (1) and (2), to investigate the relationship between the severity of the optometric anomalies and the magnitude of any improvement in the Rate of Reading.\n\n4.

It is an autosomal recessive disease and about 70% of the Dutch CF-patients are homozygous for the delta-F508 mutation. Although the genetic mutation is identical in this group of patients, the pulmonary disease is very diverse. Causative factors are environmental and also co-genetic ones. Morbidity is caused by chronic inflammation and infection of the lungs, which leads to irreversible lung damage. \n\nNeutrophils play a key role in the inflammatory cascade. It is assumed that parts of the acute inflammatory response of the neutrophil (chemotaxis/IL8 \u00b1 adhesion/selectines \u00b1 activation/TNFa \u00b1 production of e.g. superoxides or myeloperoxidase \u00b1tissue destruction) play an important role in the inflammatory process in CF. There is a higher concentration of mediators (IL-8, sICAM1, sE-Selectin, TNFa) in patients with CF than in other patients with airway infections. The CFTR protein acts not only as a Cl channel but also as a Na/H antiport and influences the intracellular pH. This might affect the functional activity of the neutrophil. Recently, new activation markers (MoPhabs A17 and A27) located on leukocytes were described that may be an early sign of pulmonary inflammation. To be able to predict and intervene in the inflammatory process would improve the prognosis especially in young children before the process of irreversible lung damage.\n\nThe use of new and powerful inhaled corticosteroid medication enables us to give anti-inflammatory therapy to young children without the systemic side-effects of orally administered steroids.", "plainEnglishSummary": "Not provided at time of registration", "primaryOutcome": "Pulmonary\n1.

Patients were randomised on a 2:1:1 basis to receive either an analgesia-based treatment regimen or a hypnotic-based treatment regimen:\n1. Analgesia-based treatment regimen (n = 84): remifentanil was initiated and titrated to provide optimal sedation and analgesia before the addition of a hypnotic agent, according to a predefined dosing algorithm\n2. Hypnotic-based treatment regimen: patients received the opioid fentanyl (n = 37) or morphine (n = 40) and a hypnotic agent for analgesia and sedation which were administered simultaneously and then titrated to response\nFor all three treatment groups, on days 1 - 3 the hypnotic agent was propofol, on days 4 - 5 propofol was substituted with midazolam.\n\nPatient monitoring:\nAll patients were intensively monitored throughout the study. Baseline Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), SAS, Pain intensity (PI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded prior to the administration of study drugs. When available, intra-cranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) were also recorded. SAS, PI, MAP, HR, ICP and CPP were then recorded at the time of any changes in study drug infusion rates or bolus dosing and at 10 minute intervals afterwards until adequate SAS/PI scores were attained. Once target SAS and PI scores were attained, haemodynamic monitoring was performed at 1 - 4 hour intervals. In addition, haemodynamic parameters were recorded at the start of down-titrations of study drugs for neurological assessment of patients and when the assessments were completed. The SAS, PI, MAP, HR, ICP and CPP were also recorded at the start of and at the time of adequate transitioning from propofol to midazolam at the end of day 3 and if a patient was extubated before day 5 of the study treatment period. These parameters were also recorded at the start of the final transition to an alternative analgesia/sedation regimen at the end of study day 5, at 20 min intervals after each down-titration of the remifentanil infusion as part of this process, at 30 and 60 min after the termination of the infusion and at final transition to an alternative opioid.\n\nPatients were continuously assessed for the occurrence of adverse events until 24 hours after permanent discontinuation of the study drugs or until ICU discharge if this occurred earlier. Serious adverse events were defined as adverse events that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening event, prolongation of hospitalisation, a disability/incapacity. Important medical events which did not result in death or were not life-threatening, were considered serious adverse events when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, they jeopardised the patient

Studies of normotensive and hypertensive individuals have confirmed that pulse pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular events than mean pressure in older adults.\nThere is evidence that the traditional beta blocker Atenolol is less effective in reducing strokes and also lowering central blood pressure and augmentation index. This may be due to a direct arterial stiffening effect but also partly due to a fall in heart rate.  However, Nebivolol is much more beta 1 selective than Atenolol and also causes vasodilatation by releasing NO which may in turn have additional benefits with regard to augmentation index and central blood pressure.\n\nAt visit 1 there will be a physical examination, blood pressure measurements, blood tests and measurements of arterial stiffness using a small sensor placed in turn against the skin on the arm and neck.
